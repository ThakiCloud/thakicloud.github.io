## Problem Definition: Why Chemistry Data?

Research consistently confirms that approximately sixty-five percent of startup failures stem from people problems. Traditional capability and experience evaluations struggle to predict team dynamics and conflict points. Saberr takes an approach that quantifies value alignment and behavioral diversity to proactively reduce risks.

## Input Data and Feature Engineering

### Fifteen-Minute Values and Motivation Survey

Both current team members and candidates complete identical surveys, with Schwartz value model's ten axes subdivided and converted into sixty-dimensional vectors. This process integrates automatically with applicant tracking systems like Workable or Greenhouse for seamless data collection.

### Behavioral Diversity Chart

Belbin and Big Five results are summarized to visualize team role matrices. These matrices serve to warn against clone teams or identify missing roles within the organization.

### Real-Time Interaction Data (Optional)

CoachBot scans Slack and email message patterns, accumulating metadata such as response delays and tone. This information connects with weekly retrospectives and one-on-one alerts to provide immediate coaching feedback.

## Core Metrics

The system calculates several key metrics to assess team compatibility. Pairwise Score measures compatibility between individuals using cosine similarity of two value vectors plus behavioral weights. Resonance represents the weighted average of team Pairwise scores to predict cohesion and communication quality. Behavior Diversity Heat-map measures role and behavioral variance to warn against concentration or gaps. Fit-Risk uses logistic regression on these metrics to estimate probability of departure or underperformance, forming the foundation for HR alert systems.

## Learning and Validation Performance

The system has demonstrated impressive accuracy across various datasets. In twenty-one startup weekend hackathons, it achieved ninety-five percent accuracy in predicting winning teams. For a twenty-person R&D team at a mid-sized company, it successfully classified one hundred percent of top and bottom performers by KPI. A three-month CoachBot pilot showed nineteen percent improvement in team behavioral clarity and twelve percent increase in perceived performance. An NHS six-month trial resulted in twenty-two percent improvement in team performance and thirty-one percent increase in goal clarity.

## Product Module Structure

### Saberr Base

During the hiring phase, the system matches existing team vectors with candidate vectors to automatically generate team-fit reports. The survey takes fifteen minutes to complete, with results immediately available within the applicant tracking system.

### Saberr CoachBot

As a Slack application, CoachBot automatically reminds teams about meetings, one-on-ones, and retrospectives while summarizing conversation logs to suggest behavioral improvement actions. Investing just one and a half hours monthly for six months has shown average performance improvements of twenty-two percent.

## Organizational Implementation Guide

The implementation follows a structured approach across multiple phases. During team DNA collection, initial member surveys establish baselines and help articulate core team values. For candidate first-stage filtering, only the top thirty percent by Pairwise score proceed to interviews after passing technical and experience requirements, reducing interview resources by fifty percent. Structured interviews incorporate potential conflict areas from reports into questionnaires, reducing culture misfits. During ninety-day onboarding, CoachBot weekly scripts support relationship building, decreasing early departure risk by twenty percent. For scaling up, teams use Resonance and behavioral matrices to reorganize squads while maintaining chemistry during organizational expansion.

## Operational Risks and Response Strategies

Several potential risks require careful management. Self-reporting bias, inherent in survey-based tools, can lead to exaggeration or understatement errors, addressed through quarterly re-surveys to track drift. Excessive value homogenization risks reducing diversity and creating groupthink, mitigated by setting minimum weights for Behavior Diversity. Proxy bias possibilities for race, gender, and other indirect biases require regular fairness audits and model retraining.

## Conclusion

Saberr transforms team chemistry into real-time metrics using brief surveys and conversation metadata. Simple numbers like Pairwise, Resonance, and behavioral matrices connect the entire hiring-onboarding-organizational development process into a single data pipeline.

Organizations that establish initial baselines and implement CoachBot can significantly reduce costs and time consumed by people problems. Furthermore, data-driven objective hiring and team management can establish foundations for sustainable organizational growth.
