## Introduction

The release of gpt-oss marks a significant milestone as the first open-source model family from OpenAI since GPT-2. This groundbreaking model features a mixture of experts (MoE) architecture, 128K context length, and adjustable deep reasoning capabilities. However, its native MXFP4 precision introduces unique challenges for fine-tuning that require innovative solutions.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore NVIDIA's proven workflow for fine-tuning gpt-oss models that maintains accuracy while preserving the performance benefits of FP4 precision. This approach combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with quantization-aware training (QAT) using NVIDIA TensorRT Model Optimizer.

## Understanding the gpt-oss Challenge

### The MXFP4 Precision Dilemma

OpenAI's decision to release gpt-oss at native MXFP4 precision was an industry first, but it created significant challenges for practitioners:

- **Stability Issues**: Native MXFP4 precision hasn't proven stable for gradient accumulation during fine-tuning
- **Training Difficulties**: Direct fine-tuning in FP4 can lead to convergence problems and accuracy degradation
- **Production Requirements**: Most foundational models require post-training techniques for effective deployment, especially in low-fault-tolerance industries like healthcare and finance

### Why Traditional Fine-Tuning Falls Short

The gpt-oss-120B model achieves performance comparable to OpenAI's closed-source o3 and o4 models on open benchmarks. However, out-of-the-box performance often shows room for improvement on specific downstream tasks:

- **Non-English Reasoning**: Initial scores around 16% on multilingual datasets
- **Safe Prompt Handling**: 30% pass rate on reducing unnecessary refusals of safe user prompts
- **Task-Specific Alignment**: Generic models require specialized training for domain-specific applications

## The SFT + QAT Workflow Solution

### Overview of the Approach

NVIDIA's solution involves a two-stage process that addresses the stability issues while maintaining efficiency:

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Performed on an upcasted BF16 version for stable gradient accumulation
2. **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**: Applied using NVIDIA TensorRT Model Optimizer to return to FP4 precision

This workflow enables SFT to reinforce task-specific behavior while QAT adapts the weights to the target low-precision format, delivering both alignment and performance for deployment.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Upcast Original MXFP4 Checkpoint to BF16/FP16

The first crucial step involves converting the native MXFP4 model to higher precision:

```python
# Using Hugging Face Transformers for upcasting
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the original MXFP4 model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "openai/gpt-oss-20b",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,  # Upcast to BF16
    device_map="auto"
)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("openai/gpt-oss-20b")
```

**Benefits of Upcasting:**
- Provides more stable gradients during training
- Enables QAT to effectively recover accuracy when re-quantizing back to FP4
- Acceptable trade-off since fine-tuning uses far fewer tokens than pre-training

#### Step 2: Perform Supervised Fine-Tuning

With the upcasted model, perform standard supervised fine-tuning:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Configure training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./sft_output",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=8,
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    warmup_steps=100,
    logging_steps=10,
    save_steps=500,
    fp16=False,  # Use BF16 for stability
    bf16=True,
)

# Initialize trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

# Execute fine-tuning
trainer.train()
```

#### Step 3: Quantize Using TensorRT Model Optimizer

Apply quantization to prepare the model for QAT:

```python
import modelopt.torch.quantization as mtq

# Configure quantization settings
config = mtq.MXFP4_MLP_WEIGHT_ONLY_CFG

# Define forward loop for calibration
def forward_loop(model):
    for data in calib_set:
        model(data)

# Quantize the model and prepare for QAT
model = mtq.quantize(model, config, forward_loop)
```

#### Step 4: Fine-tune the FP4 Quantized Model

The final QAT step involves fine-tuning at a smaller learning rate:

```python
# QAT configuration
qat_optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)
qat_scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(
    qat_optimizer, T_max=1000
)

# QAT training loop
for epoch in range(qat_epochs):
    for batch in train_loader:
        qat_optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        outputs = model(**batch)
        loss = outputs.loss
        
        loss.backward()
        qat_optimizer.step()
        qat_scheduler.step()
```

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Dramatic Improvements on Downstream Tasks

The SFT + QAT workflow demonstrates remarkable effectiveness across various evaluation metrics:

**Before Fine-tuning:**
- Non-English reasoning: 16% pass rate
- Safe prompt handling: 30% pass rate

**After SFT + QAT:**
- Non-English reasoning: 98% pass rate
- Safe prompt handling: 98% pass rate

This represents a **6x improvement** in non-English reasoning and **3.3x improvement** in safe prompt handling.

### Comparison of Quantization Methods

| Method | Non-English Reasoning | Safe Prompt Handling | Deployment Efficiency |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Original | 16% | 30% | High (FP4) |
| SFT Only | 85% | 82% | Low (BF16) |
| PTQ | 45% | 52% | High (FP4) |
| **SFT + QAT** | **98%** | **98%** | **High (FP4)** |

## NVFP4: The Next Generation

### Introducing NVFP4 Format

With NVIDIA Blackwell, NVFP4 introduces a new FP4 format purpose-built for both training and inference efficiency:

```python
# Switching to NVFP4 is as simple as changing one line
# From MXFP4
config = mtq.MXFP4_MLP_WEIGHT_ONLY_CFG

# To NVFP4
config = mtq.NVFP4_MLP_WEIGHT_ONLY_CFG

# For even better performance with weight-activation quantization
config = mtq.NVFP4_MLP_ONLY_CFG
```

## Best Practices and Optimization Tips

### Hyperparameter Optimization

**SFT Stage:**
- Learning rate: 2e-5 to 5e-5
- Batch size: Adjust based on GPU memory
- Epochs: 2-5 depending on dataset size
- Gradient accumulation: 4-16 steps

**QAT Stage:**
- Learning rate: 1e-5 to 5e-6 (10x smaller than SFT)
- Training duration: 500-2000 steps
- Optimizer: Adam with cosine annealing
- Calibration dataset: Representative of target distribution

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping SFT**: Direct QAT results in significantly lower accuracy
2. **Incorrect Learning Rates**: Too high learning rates in QAT can destabilize quantized weights
3. **Insufficient Calibration**: Poor calibration data leads to suboptimal quantization
4. **Premature Convergence**: Monitor validation metrics throughout QAT

### Monitoring and Validation

```python
# Essential metrics to track during training
metrics_to_monitor = {
    'training_loss': 'Primary optimization target',
    'validation_loss': 'Generalization indicator', 
    'perplexity': 'Language modeling quality',
    'task_specific_accuracy': 'Downstream performance',
    'quantization_error': 'Precision preservation'
}
```
