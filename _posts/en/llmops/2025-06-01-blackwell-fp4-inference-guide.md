> **TL;DR** NVIDIA Blackwell GPU's **FP4 (4-bit floating point) inference** represents a game-changer that maximizes AI model performance while dramatically reducing costs. DeepSeek-R1 model's **world record achievement** has proven its potential. This comprehensive guide covers **why FP4 is essential** through **practical implementation methods**.

---

NVIDIA's latest Blackwell architecture heralds another revolution in AI inference. Particularly, **FP4 (4-bit floating point) precision** inference has emerged as a key technology that can maximize existing model performance while significantly improving cost efficiency.

NVIDIA's announcement at GTC 2025 regarding DeepSeek-R1 model's inference performance world record clearly demonstrates this potential. A single NVIDIA DGX B200 system (equipped with 8 Blackwell GPUs) achieved over 250 tokens per second per user and maximum throughput exceeding 30,000 tokens per second on the massive 671 billion parameter Large Language Model (LLM) DeepSeek-R1, thanks to the powerful synergy of FP4 and optimized software stack.

So why should we focus on 4-bit inference on Blackwell? And how can we apply it to our models? This guide provides the reasons and specific implementation strategies.

## Why Blackwell 4-Bit (FP4) Inference? üí°

The reasons for utilizing FP4 inference on Blackwell GPU are clear: **overwhelming performance improvements, enhanced memory efficiency, and cost reduction** benefits can be achieved simultaneously.

### Revolutionary Hardware Acceleration

**2nd Generation Transformer Engine**: Blackwell GPU features a 2nd generation Transformer Engine that hardware-accelerates FP4 data types, providing 2x computational throughput per clock compared to Hopper architecture's FP8.

**Micro-tensor Scaling**: To overcome FP4's narrow dynamic range, different scale values are applied every 32 elements to minimize accuracy loss.

**I/O Scalability**: 5th generation NVLink provides 1.8TB/s bandwidth between GPUs, significantly alleviating MPI All-reduce bottlenecks during massive LLM serving.

### Remarkable Performance and Throughput Increases

NVIDIA Blackwell GPU demonstrates **over 3x inference throughput** compared to previous Hopper architecture (FP8) on Llama 3.1 70B, Llama 3.1 405B, and DeepSeek-R1 models through FP4 precision and TensorRT-LLM software.

For DeepSeek-R1 671B model, throughput increased approximately **36x** since January 2025, resulting in approximately **32x improvement** in cost per token.

In MLPerf 4.1 benchmarks, B200 FP4 recorded **4x higher performance** in Llama-2 70B inference token throughput compared to H100 FP8.

### Memory Efficiency and Cost Reduction

FP4 quantization reduces model weight memory usage to approximately 1/4 compared to BF16 and approximately 1/2 compared to FP8. For example, Flux.1-dev image generation model can achieve up to **5.2x compression** in VRAM usage with FP4 compared to FP16.

This enables running larger models within the same GPU memory or processing more user requests simultaneously. According to SemiAnalysis analysis, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) can be reduced by **2-3x** within the same power and rack space.

### Accuracy Preservation

Many developers worry about accuracy degradation when transitioning to lower precision. However, **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)** using NVIDIA's TensorRT Model Optimizer shows **minimal accuracy loss** compared to FP8 or BF16 baselines on models like DeepSeek-R1, Llama 3.1 405B, and Llama 3.3 70B.

If fine-tuning datasets are available, **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** can achieve **lossless FP4 quantization** compared to BF16 baselines, as demonstrated with Nemotron 4 15B and 340B models.

### Robust Software Ecosystem

NVIDIA provides a comprehensive software stack optimized for Blackwell architecture and FP4, including **TensorRT-LLM, TensorRT, TensorRT Model Optimizer, cuDNN, and CUTLASS**. Major AI frameworks including PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and LLM service frameworks like vLLM and Ollama also support Blackwell.

In summary, Blackwell's native FP4 support represents a game-changer that dramatically reduces memory usage per model parameter, improves throughput by up to 5x, and significantly lowers datacenter TCO.

## Getting Started with 4-Bit Blackwell Inference: Step-by-Step Guide üõ†Ô∏è

To leverage FP4 inference benefits on Blackwell GPU, **quantization** of existing BF16/FP16 models is essential. Simply loading models cannot provide FP4's speed and memory advantages. Here are recommended workflows for different situations:

The approach varies depending on your specific scenario. If using models from NeMo FP4 catalog that are already quantized, no additional action is needed - simply download from NGC and convert to TensorRT-LLM engine. For BF16 checkpoints from Hugging Face or other sources, PTQ (Post-Training Quantization) is required using TensorRT-LLM AutoDeploy. For accuracy-sensitive models in medical or financial domains, QAT or MLE re-fine-tuning is recommended through NeMo QAT followed by TensorRT-LLM engine conversion. If you have sufficient memory and prioritize latency over throughput, you can maintain existing FP8/BF16 paths as Blackwell can still execute them, though FP4 advantages would be limited.

### Workflow ‚ë†: Pre-Quantized NeMo FP4 Model Deployment (Easiest Method)

NVIDIA NeMo catalog provides various models already quantized to FP4.

**Model Download:**
```bash
nemo pull stt_en_conformer_transducer_xl_fp4
```

**TensorRT-LLM Engine Build:**
```bash
trtllm-build --checkpoint stt_fp4.nemo --dtype fp4
```

**Serving:** Deploy the built engine using trtllm-server or similar tools. Expect up to 20 PFLOPS FP4 performance on B200 GPU.

### Workflow ‚ë°: BF16 ‚Üí FP4 Conversion Using PTQ (AutoDeploy) (Fast and Efficient)

Use this when you want to quickly convert existing BF16 models to FP4. TensorRT-LLM v10's AutoDeploy pipeline enables FP4 engine generation through PTQ in just a few steps.

**(Optional) ONNX Conversion:** Convert models to ONNX format.
```bash
# Example: Using transformers library
transformers-onnx-export mymodel --dtype bf16
```

**Representative Dataset Collection:** Prepare 512-1024 representative input samples in JSONL format for model calibration.

**AutoDeploy Execution:** Use TensorRT-LLM's `deploy` API.
```python
from tensorrt_llm.torch.auto_deploy import deploy

deploy(
    model_or_path="onnx/mymodel.onnx", # or PyTorch model path
    calib_data="calib.jsonl",
    out_dir="engine_fp4",
    precision="fp4"
)
```

**Engine Validation:** Verify token accuracy of generated FP4 engine using `trtllm-run`. Target accuracy of 99%+ is typical.

**Tip:** Adding channel-wise scaling techniques like SmoothQuant or AWQ can further minimize accuracy loss in layers with wide dynamic ranges (e.g., embeddings).

### Workflow ‚ë¢: Maximum Accuracy Through QAT (Accuracy Maximization)

For fields where accuracy is critical, such as medical or financial applications, QAT can nearly eliminate accuracy loss.

**NeMo Framework Utilization:** Use NeMo to load models and enable QAT for fine-tuning.
```python
# Example code snippet
# nemo_llm = nemo.from_pretrained("mymodel_bf16.nemo")
# trainer.enable_quantization(fp4=True, mt_scale=True) # mt_scale enables micro-tensor scaling
# trainer.fit(nemo_llm) # 3-5 epoch fine-tuning
```

**Validation:** Verify accuracy degradation is less than 0.2pp in evaluation metrics like BLEU and F1 scores.

**TensorRT-LLM Engine Export:** Convert QAT-completed models to TensorRT-LLM engines for deployment. QAT provides ¬±0.1%p higher accuracy and stable performance compared to PTQ, making it particularly recommended for interactive AI services (chatbots, RAG).

## Additional Considerations for Production Deployment üìã

**HBM3e Memory Capacity:** B200 GPU features 192GB HBM3e memory, opening possibilities for loading GPT-MoE 2T parameter-class massive models without sharding.

**KV Paged Cache:** Enabled by default from TensorRT-LLM v10, contributing to achieving up to 30x higher token throughput per second and low latency (e.g., 8ms).

**NVLink Fabric:** NVL72 configuration (72 GPUs) makes a single rack operate like one massive 20 PFLOPS FP4 virtual GPU.

**MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) Partitioning:** Lightweight models (e.g., under 7B) quantized with FP4 can increase service density by 2-3x in multi-tenant environments through GPU partitioning via MIG.

## Conclusion: Experience the Future of AI Inference with Blackwell FP4! üåü

NVIDIA Blackwell architecture's native FP4 support elevates AI inference performance and efficiency to unprecedented levels. It dramatically reduces memory usage per model parameter (1/4 compared to BF16), improves throughput by up to 5x, and significantly lowers datacenter Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

However, remember that **quantization processes are essential** to maximize these benefits.

- For immediately usable solutions, utilize **pre-quantized models from NeMo FP4 catalog**.
- If you have your own BF16 models, generate FP4 engines in minutes through **TensorRT-LLM AutoDeploy (PTQ)**.
- For services requiring the highest accuracy levels, retrain and deploy models through **NeMo QAT**.

Through these guidelines, we hope you can fully unleash Blackwell GPU's tremendous potential while safely maintaining model accuracy and opening new horizons for AI services!
