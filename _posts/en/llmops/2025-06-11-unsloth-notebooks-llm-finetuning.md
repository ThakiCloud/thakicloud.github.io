## Classification by Fine-Tuning Methods

### üìù **Conversational**

Fine-tuning for natural conversations with users involves training models to engage in human-like dialogue with appropriate context understanding and response generation.

### ü¶ô **Alpaca Format**

The standard format from Stanford Alpaca project provides structured instruction-input-output formatting that has become widely adopted in the fine-tuning community.

### üéØ **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**

Advanced optimization technique based on reinforcement learning that significantly improves model response quality through sophisticated reward modeling and policy optimization.

### üëÅÔ∏è **Vision**

Multimodal fine-tuning that processes text and images together, enabling models to understand and respond to visual content alongside textual information.

## Practical Usage Methods

### Getting Started with Google Colab

The process involves several straightforward steps:

**Notebook Selection**: Choose notebooks matching your desired model and use case
**Open in Colab**: Click the "Open in Colab" button
**Runtime Setup**: Select GPU runtime (T4 or higher specification)
**Step-by-Step Execution**: Run notebook cells in order

### Running on Kaggle

Kaggle environment offers the same notebooks with additional advantages:

**Longer Execution Time**: 30 hours of free GPU usage per week
**More Storage Space**: 20GB output data storage capability
**Team Collaboration**: Share notebooks and collaborate with team members

## Advanced Use Cases

### üß† **Reasoning Enhancement**

Chain of Thought (CoT) fine-tuning for CodeForces problem solving demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities through structured problem-solving approaches.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Calling**

Training models to call external APIs or functions enables integration with external systems and services, expanding model capabilities beyond text generation.

### üé® **Unsloth Studio**
