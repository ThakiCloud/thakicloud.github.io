## Installation and Setup

Getting started with AgentOps is straightforward:

### Step 1: Install the SDK

```bash
pip install agentops
```

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Visit [AgentOps.ai](https://www.agentops.ai/)
2. Create an account and generate your API key
3. Keep your API key secure

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

```bash
export AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>
```

### Step 4: Initialize in Your Code

```python
import agentops

# Initialize AgentOps at the start of your application
agentops.init()

# Your existing agent code continues to work unchanged
# AgentOps automatically instruments your agents
```

## Framework Integration

AgentOps provides native integration with popular agent frameworks:

### CrewAI Integration

```python
import agentops
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

agentops.init()

# Your CrewAI agents are automatically monitored
agent = Agent(
    role='Data Analyst',
    goal='Analyze sales data',
    backstory='Expert in data analysis'
)

task = Task(
    description='Analyze Q4 sales trends',
    agent=agent
)

crew = Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=[task])
result = crew.kickoff()  # Automatically tracked by AgentOps
```

### LangChain Integration

```python
import agentops
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

agentops.init()

# LangChain agents work seamlessly with AgentOps
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description")

# All interactions are automatically logged
response = agent.run("What's the weather like today?")
```

### Autogen Integration

```python
import agentops
import autogen

agentops.init()

# Autogen multi-agent conversations are fully tracked
config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": "your-key"}]

assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER"
)

# Multi-agent interactions are visualized in AgentOps
user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="Solve this problem")
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Event Tracking

For specialized monitoring needs, AgentOps allows custom event tracking:

```python
import agentops

# Track custom events
agentops.record_event(
    event_type="custom_analysis",
    metadata={
        "data_source": "sales_db",
        "processing_time": 2.5,
        "records_processed": 10000
    }
)
```

### Session Management

Organize your monitoring data with session management:

```python
# Start a named session
session = agentops.start_session(
    session_name="quarterly_analysis",
    tags=["finance", "q4_2024"]
)

# Your agent operations
perform_analysis()

# End session with summary
session.end_session(
    end_state="success",
    summary="Completed Q4 analysis successfully"
)
```

### Error Handling and Alerts

Set up automated alerts for critical issues:

```python
# Configure error thresholds
agentops.configure_alerts(
    error_rate_threshold=0.05,  # 5% error rate
    cost_threshold=100.00,      # $100 daily limit
    latency_threshold=30.0      # 30 second response time
)
```

## Best Practices for Production Use

### 1. Environment-Specific Configuration

```python
import os
import agentops

# Use different configurations for different environments
if os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "production":
    agentops.init(
        api_key=os.getenv("AGENTOPS_PROD_KEY"),
        default_tags=["production"],
        auto_start_session=True
    )
else:
    agentops.init(
        api_key=os.getenv("AGENTOPS_DEV_KEY"),
        default_tags=["development"],
        auto_start_session=False
    )
```

### 2. Cost Optimization Strategies

- **Monitor token usage patterns** to identify optimization opportunities
- **Set up budget alerts** to prevent unexpected costs
- **Use cost-effective models** for non-critical operations
- **Implement caching** for repeated operations

### 3. Security Considerations

- **Regularly review access logs** for suspicious activity
- **Implement data sanitization** before logging sensitive information
- **Use environment variables** for API keys and secrets
- **Enable audit trails** for compliance requirements

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Problems

```python
# Test your AgentOps connection
try:
    agentops.init()
    print("AgentOps connected successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
    # Check API key and network connectivity
```

### Performance Impact

AgentOps is designed to have minimal performance impact, but you can optimize further:

```python
# Configure sampling for high-volume applications
agentops.init(
    sample_rate=0.1,  # Sample 10% of events
    async_mode=True   # Use async logging
)
```

### Data Privacy

```python
# Configure data filtering for sensitive information
agentops.init(
    filter_sensitive_data=True,
    custom_filters=["email", "phone", "ssn"]
)
```
