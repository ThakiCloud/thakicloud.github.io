## What is NeMo QAT?

**NeMo QAT (Quantization-Aware Training)** is a quantization-aware training technology provided by the NVIDIA NeMo framework that maximizes the accuracy of final quantized models by simulating quantization effects during the model training process.

### Core Concepts

**Quantization Simulation During Training**: Applies FP4 quantization effects in advance during forward pass
**Straight-Through Estimator**: Uses FP32 gradients during backward pass
**Micro-tensor Scaling**: Applies individual scale factors every 32 elements
**Progressive Quantization**: Starts with high precision in early training, gradually transitioning to FP4

### PTQ vs QAT Comparison

The fundamental difference between Post-Training Quantization and Quantization-Aware Training lies in their approach and results. PTQ requires no training time and provides immediate conversion, but typically results in 0.5-2% accuracy loss compared to baseline with low memory requirements and easy application, making it suitable for rapid prototyping. In contrast, QAT requires 3-5 additional training epochs with higher memory requirements for training and moderate application difficulty, but achieves ±0.1% accuracy compared to baseline, making it ideal for production deployment.

## Why is NeMo QAT Necessary? 💡

### Accuracy-Priority Scenarios

**Financial Services**: In credit evaluation and fraud detection, accuracy degradation directly translates to financial losses.

**Autonomous Driving**: In autonomous driving systems where safety is paramount, model accuracy directly means safety.

### Actual Performance Comparison

Based on Nemotron 4 340B model benchmarks:

QAT demonstrates superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics. While BF16 baseline achieves 78.9% on MMLU, 92.3% on GSM8K, and 73.2% on HumanEval using 100% memory, PTQ FP4 shows 77.8% on MMLU, 90.1% on GSM8K, and 71.8% on HumanEval with 25% memory usage. Remarkably, **QAT FP4** achieves **78.8%** on MMLU, **92.1%** on GSM8K, and **73.0%** on HumanEval while maintaining the same 25% memory usage, demonstrating minimal accuracy loss.
