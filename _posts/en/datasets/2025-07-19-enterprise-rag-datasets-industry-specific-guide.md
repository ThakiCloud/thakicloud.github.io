## RAG vs Fine-tuning Strategy Guide

### Industry-Specific Optimal Approaches

The system provides optimal configurations for different industries. Banking applications use 512 chunk sizes with 50 overlap, text-embedding-ada-002 embeddings, Pinecone vector stores, and cross-encoder reranking models. Legal applications require larger 1024 chunk sizes with 100 overlap for longer context needs, sentence-transformers embeddings, Weaviate vector stores, and enhanced reranking models. Medical applications use smaller 256 chunk sizes with 25 overlap for accuracy, all-mpnet-base-v2 embeddings, Qdrant vector stores, and specialized reranking models.

### Hybrid Approach Implementation

The hybrid system implements three-stage development: Stage 1 involves RAG system deployment with vector store construction for each industry. Stage 2 collects user Q&A logs during monitoring periods, evaluating RAG response quality and identifying improvement candidates with quality scores below 0.7. Stage 3 performs fine-tuning on selected data, preparing training data and creating fine-tuning jobs with improved answers combined with RAG-retrieved contexts.

## Security and Compliance Considerations

### Data Security Framework

The secure RAG framework implements row-level security with role-based access rules for different user types including banking analysts, legal counsel, and medical researchers. Each role has specific allowed tables, restricted fields, and data masking requirements.

**Data Governance Implementation**: The system classifies data sensitivity, determines retention periods, enables access logging, and implements encryption at rest and in transit.

### GDPR and Privacy Compliance

The privacy-compliant RAG system ensures GDPR compliance through PII detection, automatic anonymization, and implementation of right to erasure by finding and marking user data for deletion while updating vector embeddings.

## Performance Optimization and Monitoring

### RAG Performance Metrics

The performance monitoring system measures retrieval quality through precision and recall, context relevance, answer relevance, faithfulness, and completeness. Performance indicators include response times, token usage, and cost per query.

### Automatic Performance Tuning

The auto RAG optimizer optimizes chunk sizes by testing various sizes with performance evaluation, and optimizes retrieval parameters through grid search across top-k values, similarity thresholds, and rerank parameters.

## Practical Implementation Example

### Multi-Industry RAG Platform

The comprehensive platform includes industry processors for banking, insurance, legal, medical, automotive, and securities sectors. The system initializes industry-specific RAG systems through data preprocessing, vector store construction, and RAG pipeline setup.

**Multi-Industry Querying**: The system handles queries across multiple industries based on user permissions, integrates results from different sectors, and ranks sources by confidence scores to provide comprehensive integrated answers.
