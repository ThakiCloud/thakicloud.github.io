## Overview

**NVIDIA OpenCodeReasoning** is the **largest reasoning-based synthetic dataset for competitive programming** to date. Comprising **735,255 samples** and **28,319 unique problems**, it is specialized for **Python language** and designed for **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**.

This dataset contains high-quality reasoning-based responses generated by **R1 models** and integrates problems from **10 major competitive programming platforms** including **CodeForces, LeetCode, and CodeChef**. Released under the **CC BY 4.0 license**, it is freely available for both commercial and non-commercial use.

## Dataset Scale and Composition

### Overall Statistics

The dataset contains **735,255 total samples** of reasoning-based solutions generated by R1 models, **28,319 unique problems** from competitive programming platforms, supports **Python language** exclusively for focused development, includes **2 data splits** (split_0 and split_1), and is stored in efficient **Parquet format** with 100K-1M file sizes.

### Platform-wise Data Distribution

**CodeForces** leads with **10,069 problems** generating **386,948 samples** (52.6% of total). **CodeChef** contributes 3,796 problems with 72,925 samples (9.9%). **AIZU** provides 2,123 problems for 62,476 samples (8.5%). **HackerEarth** offers 2,269 problems producing 59,181 samples (8.0%). **AtCoder** contributes 2,043 problems with 47,222 samples (6.4%). **GeeksForGeeks** adds 2,667 problems for 37,602 samples (5.1%). **Codewars** provides 2,493 problems generating 34,326 samples (4.7%). **Kattis** contributes 1,187 problems with 13,095 samples (1.8%). **HackerRank** offers 895 problems for 10,955 samples (1.5%). **LeetCode** provides 777 problems with 10,525 samples (1.4%).

### Data Source Details

The original dataset collection includes **TACO**, **APPS**, **CodeContests**, and **open-r1/codeforces**. Test splits from CodeContests and open-r1/codeforces are excluded to prevent data contamination and ensure strict separation.

## Data Field Structure

### Key Field Descriptions

The dataset structure includes unique identifiers for each problem, competitive programming problem descriptions (split_0 only), complete reasoning responses from R1 models, extracted code portions from R1 responses, original dataset names, dataset licenses, original dataset split names, competitive programming platform names, problem difficulty labels, and APPS/TACO dataset search indices (split_1 only).

### Split Structure

**Split_0** contains 567,850 samples with complete problem descriptions included, ready for immediate use, and direct SFT training application. **Split_1** includes 167,405 samples with reference-based structure (input = "-"), requires separate loading from TACO/APPS datasets, and optimizes storage space efficiency.

## Usage Methods and Implementation

### Basic Data Loading

Users can load Split_0 with complete problems included and Split_1 with reference-based structure using the Hugging Face Datasets library. The loading process displays sample counts for each split to verify successful data access.

### Split_1 Problem Content Restoration

For Split_1 data restoration, users need to load reference datasets including TACO and APPS. The restoration process involves iterating through Split_1 data, verifying input fields are marked as "-", confirming dataset sources are either "taco" or "apps", retrieving original problem content from reference datasets using provided indices, and creating restored items with complete problem descriptions.

### Platform-wise Data Analysis

Analysis capabilities include collecting platform statistics, tracking difficulty distributions, calculating total samples per platform, and generating comprehensive reports showing platform contributions and difficulty breakdowns.

## R1 Model-Based Reasoning Generation

### Reasoning Quality Characteristics

**R1 model reasoning** features explicit step-by-step thinking processes, detailed problem analysis and solution strategies, comprehensive code implementation and verification processes, and consideration of edge cases and optimization approaches.

### Reasoning Response Structure

A typical R1-generated response includes **problem analysis** explaining the core challenge and applicable algorithms, **solution strategy** outlining step-by-step approaches and decision criteria, **code implementation** with detailed explanations and complexity analysis, and **test case verification** demonstrating correctness with example inputs and outputs.

## Data Quality and Characteristics

### Quality Management Process

**Original data verification** ensures problems from 10 major platforms are validated, duplicate problems are removed and normalized, and difficulty distributions are balanced. **R1 model generation quality** involves logical consistency verification, code executability confirmation, and reasoning process clarity evaluation. **License compatibility** includes platform-specific license verification, commercial use feasibility review, and redistribution condition specification.

### Difficulty Distribution Analysis

The analysis process involves collecting difficulty statistics across all samples, categorizing problems by difficulty levels, calculating percentage distributions, and generating comprehensive difficulty reports showing the dataset's balanced representation across various complexity levels.

## Applications and Use Cases

### SFT Model Training

For supervised fine-tuning applications, the dataset enables conversion to standard prompt formats, metadata preservation including source and difficulty information, and preparation of training samples optimized for model learning.

### Code Generation Model Evaluation

Evaluation capabilities include syntactic validity checking through AST parsing, main function presence verification, input handling assessment, comment quality evaluation, and comprehensive quality metric calculation across representative sample sets.

## OpenCodeReasoning Model Series

### Pre-trained Models

## License and Usage Conditions

### CC BY 4.0 License

The license permits **commercial use** with free commercial utilization, **modification** allowing data changes and processing, **distribution** enabling redistribution of original and modified versions, and **private use** for personal and organizational internal applications. Requirements include **attribution** to NVIDIA developers, **license notice** displaying CC BY 4.0 license, and **change indication** when modifications are made.

### Individual Dataset License Considerations

Users must verify licenses of original datasets, as each source dataset may have different licensing terms that need to be respected alongside the CC BY 4.0 license of the processed dataset.

## Performance Benchmarking

### Evaluation Metrics

Assessment includes **code correctness** through test case pass rates, **reasoning quality** via logical consistency evaluation, **execution efficiency** considering time and space complexity optimization, and **readability** assessing code style and comment quality.
