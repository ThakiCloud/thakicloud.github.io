## Introduction: The Decisive Moment for the Developer Profession

In August 2025, GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke's **"Developers, Reinvented"** is a revolutionary manifesto that goes beyond simple technology trend analysis. The reality revealed through in-depth interviews with 22 active developers is shocking: **"Accept AI, or you'd better quit this profession."**

This isn't a hypothetical scenario. It's the change happening right now, at this moment. Dohmke's research shows that the developer profession isn't disappearing but is **being completely reborn in a new form**. A fundamental transformation from code writers to **strategists who orchestrate AI agents** is becoming reality.

In this post, we'll analyze in detail the 4 stages of developer evolution revealed by CEO Dohmke, the identity changes they experience, and the ripple effects this has on education and society as a whole.

## 1. The Frontlines of Change: The Reality Shown by 22 Developers

### Journey from Skepticism to Innovation

The 22 developers who participated in CEO Dohmke's research are all pioneers who use **AI tools as the core of their workflow**. However, their beginning was far from smooth. Most of their reactions when first encountering AI tools were **"Pretty cool, but just a gimmick"** - healthy skepticism.

This initial skepticism arose from the collision between high expectations and AI's unpredictable capabilities. Many developers give up at this stage, judging AI tools as "unhelpful," but those who continued experimenting experienced a decisive **"aha! moment"**.

### The Power of Continuous Experimentation

The common trait of successful developers was **strong motivation to anticipate and prepare for comprehensive reorganization of the future work environment**. They continuously experimented with various AI tools even when the tools weren't consistently helpful. As one developer said, the urgency that **"you either accept AI or leave this profession"** was the driving force behind their actions.

This experimental spirit was a **survival strategy** beyond mere curiosity. Even when AI wasn't perfect, they found ways to understand and utilize its limitations. As a result, they were able to systematically develop AI collaboration skills through daily trial and error.

## 2. The 4 Stages of Developer Evolution: From Skeptic to Strategist

### Stage 1: AI Skeptic

First-stage developers **lightly use AI for small tasks and questions**. They mainly use code autocompletion features and have low tolerance for repetition and errors. The key at this stage is **abandoning expectations for one-time success**.

Many developers get frustrated and give up on AI tools at this stage, but those who persist begin to understand AI's characteristics. By accepting the reality that perfect results can't be obtained immediately, they lay the foundation to move to the next stage.

### Stage 2: AI Explorer

In the second stage, they begin **using AI for debugging, boilerplate code, and code snippet writing**. They use both autocompletion and chat features, employing copy-paste methods from browser-based LLMs.

The key to this stage is **beginning to understand AI's limitations**. Developers use AI for brainstorming more complex tasks, accept repetitive prompting, and realize that when results aren't good, it's more efficient to **start over from the beginning** rather than pushing forward.

### Stage 3: AI Collaborator

The third stage involves **actively co-creating with AI and developing context engineering intuition**. Using AI-supported IDEs to perform multi-step tasks and multi-file changes, they develop habits such as:

- **Asking for plans first**: Requesting AI to establish an overall plan before starting work
- **Curating agent rules**: Adjusting AI's behavior patterns to match the developer's work style
- **Strategic tool and model switching**: Learning AI's "thought process" and selecting optimal tools for situations

Developers at this stage also begin **participating in internal discussions or demos sharing effective prompts, use cases, and learned lessons**. This is the process of creating team-level AI utilization culture beyond individual learning.

### Stage 4: AI Strategist

Final-stage developers treat **AI as a powerful partner for feature development, complex tasks, and large-scale refactoring**. They build sophisticated multi-agent workflows using planning and coding models, gradually expanding autonomy and parallel processing.

Developers who reach this stage **unanimously declare that their role has fundamentally changed**. Now their focus is on **Delegation and Verification**.

## 3. New Developer Identity: Delegator and Verifier

### The Art of Delegation

The **delegation** that stage 4 developers speak of isn't simply assigning tasks to AI. It includes the following sophisticated processes:

**Setting up agents with rich context and instructions**: Providing sufficient background information and clear guidelines for AI to succeed

**Designing and refining prompts**: Developing effective questions and instructions to achieve desired results

**Reviewing AI's plans and trade-offs**: Analyzing AI's proposed solutions and their pros and cons

**Pre-execution adjustments**: Final fine-tuning for optimization before execution

### The Importance of Verification

**Verification** is equally important as delegation. Stage 4 developers have developed sophisticated abilities to:

**Evaluate code quality**: Quickly assessing whether AI-generated code meets standards

**Identify potential issues**: Spotting bugs, security vulnerabilities, or performance problems

**Ensure architectural consistency**: Verifying that new code aligns with existing system architecture

**Validate business logic**: Confirming that implementation correctly reflects requirements

## 4. Fundamental Changes in Work Patterns
