## Key Messages at a Glance

- **AI has conquered even the last bastion of creativity.** In front of AI that can solve International Mathematical Olympiad problems, creative thinking, which we believed was uniquely human, is no longer a safe zone.
- **In the 'homework assistance' AI era, opportunities for logical thinking development are disappearing.** The more students depend on AI, the greater the risk of hindering critical thinking ability development.
- **Future core competencies are communication, empathy, and value creation.** Language skills, reading, writing, communication, and logical thinking have become more important than ever.
- **AI should be used as an amplifier, not a replacement.** When used wisely as a tool to simulate and understand the world, it can enhance human capabilities.
- **Thoughtfulness is the key to survival.** Autonomous thinking ability that doesn't depend on entertainment and AI determines the future.
- **Social entrepreneurship is the new success formula.** Bringing joy to others and making the world a better place is the key to sustainable value creation.
- **Trust networks are the foundation of future society.** Strong connections of kind, intelligent, and mutually trusting people are the power to navigate an uncertain future.

## 1. The Last Fortress of Creativity Falls

### The Shock of AI Conquering Math Olympiads

The most powerful message Dr. Po-Shen Loh delivered is this: **AI now solves even International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems**.

Math olympiads aren't just about simple calculations. They're the highest level competitions of human intelligence requiring creative thinking, pattern recognition, logical reasoning, and sometimes intuitive leaps. The fact that AI has conquered this domain means we need to fundamentally redefine the concept of creativity we believed was "uniquely human."

### The End of the Creativity Myth

- **Past**: "AI is only good at calculations. Creativity is uniquely human."
- **Present**: "AI is creatively solving math olympiad problems."
- **Future**: "Then what is humanity's unique value?"

This isn't simply a matter of technological advancement. It's time for a **fundamental redefinition of human identity**.

## 2. Educational Warning Signs: The Trap of AI Dependence

### The Dark Side of the Homework Revolution

Students using AI to solve homework has become commonplace. While it appears to increase efficiency on the surface, Dr. Loh warns that this **deprives critical opportunities for logical thinking development**.

### Atrophy of Thinking Muscles

Homework isn't just an assignment but a **training ground for developing thinking skills**. The more we depend on AI:

- Problem analysis abilities deteriorate
- We skip step-by-step thinking processes
- We miss learning opportunities through failure and retry
- Development of our own thinking patterns is hindered

This is like losing basic arithmetic skills by depending only on calculators. What's more serious is that this time, **the muscles of thinking itself atrophy**.

## 3. Core Competencies for Future Survival

### Fundamentals That Have Become More Important

Paradoxically, in the AI era, the following abilities have become **more important than ever**:

| Competency | Importance | AI Era Value |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **Language Skills** | Communication basics | Accurate prompting when collaborating with AI |
| **Reading** | Information interpretation | Critical analysis of biased AI outputs |
| **Writing** | Organizing thoughts | Expressing unique perspectives and ideas |
| **Communication** | Human relationships | Irreplaceable domain by AI |
| **Logical Thinking** | Problem solving | Validating the validity of AI outputs |

### The Necessity of Critical Thinking

All these skills converge toward one goal: **developing critical thinking**. The key to survival is the ability to verify the logic and validity of AI-provided answers rather than unconditionally accepting them.

## 4. AI as an Amplifier, Not a Replacement

### The Right Way to Use AI

Dr. Loh emphasizes that AI should be used as a **tool to simulate and understand the world**. This means:

- **Hypothesis testing**: Using AI to verify our ideas and assumptions
- **Scenario exploration**: Examining various possibilities and their consequences
- **Knowledge expansion**: Accessing information and perspectives beyond our experience
- **Creative stimulation**: Getting inspiration for new ideas and approaches

### Avoiding the Dependency Trap

However, there's an important caveat. AI should **enhance our thinking, not replace it**. When we let AI do all the thinking, we lose the opportunity to develop our own cognitive abilities.

## 5. Thoughtfulness: The Core of Survival

### The Importance of Autonomous Thinking

Dr. Loh particularly emphasizes **"thoughtfulness"** as a key survival skill. This means:

- **Independent judgment**: Making decisions based on our own analysis and judgment
- **Deep reflection**: Taking time to think deeply about problems and situations
- **Resistance to instant gratification**: Not being swayed by entertainment and immediate pleasures
- **Continuous learning**: Maintaining curiosity and the will to learn

### The Danger of Entertainment Dependence

Modern society is full of entertainment and instant gratification. Social media, games, streaming services, and now AI provide immediate satisfaction. However, this environment can weaken our ability for deep thinking and reflection.

## 6. Social Entrepreneurship: The New Success Formula

### Value Creation Through Helping Others

Dr. Loh proposes **social entrepreneurship** as a new success model. This means:

- **Creating value for others**: Focusing on how to help and bring joy to others
- **Solving social problems**: Addressing real problems in society
- **Sustainable impact**: Creating long-term positive change, not just short-term profits
- **Collaborative approach**: Working together rather than competing

### Examples of Social Entrepreneurship

- **Educational innovation**: Developing new learning methods and tools
- **Healthcare accessibility**: Making medical services available to more people
- **Environmental solutions**: Developing technologies and services for environmental protection
- **Community building**: Creating platforms and spaces for people to connect and help each other

## 7. Trust Networks: The Foundation of Future Society

### The Power of Human Connections

In an uncertain future, **trust networks** become more important than ever. Dr. Loh emphasizes the importance of building relationships with **kind, intelligent, and mutually trusting people**.

### Characteristics of Strong Networks

- **Mutual support**: Helping each other in difficult times
- **Knowledge sharing**: Sharing information and insights
- **Collaborative problem-solving**: Working together to solve complex problems
- **Emotional support**: Providing psychological stability and encouragement

## 8. Practical Strategies for the AI Era

### For Individuals

1. **Develop fundamental skills**: Strengthen language, reading, writing, and communication abilities
2. **Practice critical thinking**: Always question and verify AI outputs
3. **Maintain curiosity**: Continuously learn new things and explore various fields
4. **Build relationships**: Invest in building trust networks with others
5. **Find your unique value**: Discover what only you can do

### For Educators

1. **Change teaching methods**: Focus on critical thinking rather than memorization
2. **Integrate AI education**: Teach proper ways to use AI
3. **Emphasize creativity**: Encourage original thinking and creative problem-solving
4. **Foster collaboration**: Create opportunities for students to work together
5. **Develop social skills**: Emphasize communication and empathy

### For Organizations

1. **Invest in human development**: Focus on employee growth and learning
2. **Create collaborative culture**: Build an environment where people can work together
3. **Pursue social value**: Consider impact on society beyond profits
4. **Embrace technological change**: Actively adopt and utilize new technologies
5. **Build trust**: Establish transparent and honest organizational culture

## Conclusion: Preparing for an Uncertain Future

Dr. Po-Shen Loh's message is clear: **The AI era requires fundamental changes in how we think about human value and education**. Creativity is no longer humanity's exclusive domain, but this doesn't mean humans have become unnecessary.

Rather, we need to focus on what humans can do better: **communication, empathy, critical thinking, and value creation**. Most importantly, we must use AI as a tool to amplify our capabilities, not replace our thinking.

The future belongs to those who can **think independently, collaborate with others, and create value for society**. This requires not just individual effort but changes in our educational systems and social structures.

Dr. Loh's insights provide important guidance for navigating the AI era. By embracing these changes and preparing for the future, we can not only survive but thrive in the AI era.
