## 👤 Bill Coughran

**Position:** Partner, Sequoia Capital
**Previous Position:** SVP of Engineering, Google

**Introduction:**
Bill Coughran is currently a **partner at global VC firm Sequoia Capital** and is a former **Senior Vice President of Engineering** who led engineering at Google for over 8 years.
He led an engineering organization of thousands of people covering Google's search, infrastructure, advertising systems, Chrome, and Android development teams.

**Major Achievements:**

- Contributed to Google's engineering organization vertical scaling
- Led performance improvements in Chrome, Ads, and Search systems
- Contributed to Google's early leadership team formation
- Invested in tech startups like Snowflake and Databricks at Sequoia

## 🔧 AI Evolution and Scaling Paradigm

- Modern deep learning began in earnest around **2012-2013**.
- Google used **16,000 CPU cores** to train the largest neural network at the time, proving the potential of scale.
- Core rule of thumb:
  > **Scale up models, increase data, and performance improves**

## 🧠 Multimodal Models and AI Agents

### Multimodal Systems

- **Multimodal AI** that processes various inputs/outputs like text, images, audio, video, and code is emerging as key.
- Accelerating applications in various fields (e.g., education, robotics, user interfaces).

### AI Agents

- Currently capable of only limited functions, but can be increasingly sophisticated through **reinforcement learning (RL)** and **post-training**.
- Robots are also expected to perform over 20 useful tasks indoors **within 1-2 years**.

---

## 🧱 Foundation Model Ecosystem

- Training cutting-edge LLMs requires massive resources and infrastructure → only **a few top companies** can lead.
- However, **knowledge distillation** can create various lightweight derivative models.
- The future is expected to have this structure:
  - A few general-purpose large models
  - Many lightweight/specialized models

---

## ⚙️ AI-Dedicated Hardware and System Software

### ML Hardware Core Elements

- **Reduced-Precision Linear Algebra Accelerators**
- **Ultra-high-speed Network Interconnects**

### TPU Development History

- **TPUv1**: For inference
- **TPUv2~Present**: Training + inference integration
- Latest generation: **Trillium → Ironwood**

### Analog vs Digital Inference

- **Analog inference** is promising for power efficiency, but **digital systems** still have advantages in development flexibility.
- The goal is hardware innovation capable of **10~50,000x efficiency improvements**.

---

## 🧪 AI's Impact on Scientific Fields

- Applied to high-cost simulator-based problems like weather prediction, fluid dynamics, and quantum chemistry.
- Can create **inference models tens of thousands of times faster** by learning simulator data.
- Example: Simulating millions of molecular structures in a day → accelerating scientific discovery speed.

---

## 🧵 Developer Experience: Pathways Abstraction

- Google's internal system **Pathways** can control thousands of devices with a single Python process.
- Compatible with JAX and PyTorch.
- Recently released to GCP → cloud users can **utilize large-scale TPUs with a single process**.

```python
# Pathways example: Control 10,000 devices with one Python code
model = YourModel()
output = model(input)  # Ensure scalability with single script
```

## 🛠️ Next-Generation Computing Infrastructure Direction

- Traditional algorithmic complexity analysis was centered on **operation count (op count)**.
- However, in the AI era, **memory bandwidth** and **data movement** have emerged as key performance bottlenecks.
- Particularly in AI systems:
  - **Training** and **inference** have different workload characteristics,
  - Hardware and system design optimized for each is needed.
- In conclusion, **hardware-system software-algorithm co-design** determines performance.

---

## 🤖 Feasibility of AI Junior Engineers

- **Within a year**, there's potential to implement AI at the level of **junior software engineers**.
- Simple code generation alone is insufficient; the following capabilities are required:
  - Test execution (e.g., unit/integration testing)
  - Performance debugging (e.g., latency profiling, bottleneck analysis)
  - Documentation learning and practical tool utilization (e.g., git, CI/CD, log interpretation)

---

## 🧩 Future Model Architecture: Sparse & Modular

- Jeff Dean focuses on **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** based **sparse** architecture.
- Core concepts:
  - **Activate only necessary paths** during execution → efficient use of computational resources
  - Flexible design possible with combinations of **lightweight experts** and **expensive experts**
- Future-oriented characteristics:
  - **Dynamic path selection**: Allows compute differences of tens to thousands of times depending on situation
  - **Modularized parameter expansion/compression**:
    - Expand when needed, clean up unnecessary parts with distillation or garbage collection
    - Enables continual learning and memory optimization

## 📌 Closing Insights

> "**Both algorithmic innovation and infrastructure innovation are important. Neither alone can maintain competitiveness.**"

- The equation **simply having large clusters = advantage** is no longer valid.
- True competitiveness comes from the sum of these factors:
  - ✅ **Efficient algorithm design**
  - ✅ **High-performance hardware architecture**
  - ✅ **Developer-friendly tools and frameworks**
  - ✅ **Intuitive and reliable agent-based user experience (UX)**
