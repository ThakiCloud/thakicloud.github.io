## Key Messages at a Glance

- **Software is fundamentally changing for the first time in 70 years.** Two rapid changes have occurred in recent years.
- **Three programming paradigms coexist**: Software 1.0 (code), 2.0 (neural network weights), 3.0 (English prompts)
- **LLMs are the new operating system.** They have characteristics of utilities, fabs, and operating systems all at once.
- **Currently similar to 1960s computing era.** We're using time-sharing methods on centralized clouds.
- **LLMs are "human souls".** They have encyclopedic knowledge but also many cognitive flaws.
- **Partially autonomous apps are the future.** Human-AI collaboration is key rather than full autonomy.
- **The era of programming in English has arrived.** Everyone can become a programmer.
- **Infrastructure for agents needs to be built.** New digital information consumers have emerged.

## Three Evolution Stages of Software

### Software 1.0: Traditional Coding

- **Code that directly commands computers**
- Written in programming languages like Python, JavaScript
- Basic paradigm unchanged for 70 years

### Software 2.0: Neural Network Weights

- **Neural networks trained on data**
- Weights and parameters replace explicit code
- Revolutionary change in how we solve problems

### Software 3.0: English Prompts

- **Natural language instructions to LLMs**
- Programming through conversation
- Democratization of software creation

## LLMs as Operating Systems

### Three Characteristics of LLMs

**1. Utility (Like Electricity)**
- Basic infrastructure everyone uses
- Invisible but essential service
- Standardized interface and access

**2. Fab (Like Semiconductor Manufacturing)**
- Extremely expensive to build and operate
- Requires massive capital investment
- Centralized production, distributed consumption

**3. Operating System**
- Manages resources and provides interfaces
- Enables applications to run on top
- Abstracts complexity for developers

### Current State: 1960s Computing Revisited

- **Centralized mainframes** â†’ Cloud-based LLMs
- **Time-sharing systems** â†’ API rate limits and queues
- **Terminal access** â†’ Chat interfaces and APIs
- **Batch processing** â†’ Prompt-response cycles

## The Nature of LLMs: "Human Souls"

### Encyclopedic Knowledge

LLMs possess vast knowledge across domains:
- **Literature and history**
- **Science and mathematics**
- **Culture and languages**
- **Technical expertise**

### Cognitive Limitations

But they also have human-like flaws:
- **Hallucinations and confabulation**
- **Inconsistent reasoning**
- **Bias and prejudice**
- **Lack of true understanding**

### Implications for Development

This dual nature requires:
- **Careful prompt engineering**
- **Robust verification systems**
- **Human oversight and validation**
- **Graceful error handling**

## The Future: Partially Autonomous Applications

### Why Not Full Autonomy?

Full autonomy faces several challenges:
- **Reliability concerns**
- **Ethical implications**
- **User trust issues**
- **Regulatory requirements**

### Human-AI Collaboration Model

The optimal approach combines:
- **AI for routine tasks**
- **Human for critical decisions**
- **Seamless handoffs**
- **Transparent processes**

### Examples of Partial Autonomy

**Email Management**:
- AI drafts responses
- Human reviews and approves
- AI learns from feedback

**Code Generation**:
- AI writes initial code
- Human reviews and refines
- AI assists with debugging

**Content Creation**:
- AI generates drafts
- Human edits and polishes
- AI helps with research

## Programming in English: Democratization of Development

### Natural Language as Code

Programming is becoming more accessible:
- **No syntax to learn**
- **Intuitive instructions**
- **Immediate feedback**
- **Iterative refinement**

### New Developer Categories

**Traditional Programmers**: Still needed for complex systems
**Prompt Engineers**: Specialists in AI communication
**Citizen Developers**: Domain experts who can now program
**AI-Assisted Developers**: Hybrid approach users

### Skills for the New Era

Essential skills include:
- **Clear communication**
- **Problem decomposition**
- **System thinking**
- **Quality assessment**

## Infrastructure for AI Agents

### New Digital Consumers

AI agents represent a new category of information consumers:
- **Different access patterns**
- **Unique authentication needs**
- **Specialized data formats**
- **High-volume requests**

### Required Infrastructure

**APIs for Agents**:
- Machine-readable formats
- Structured data access
- Real-time capabilities
- Scalable architectures

**Authentication Systems**:
- Agent identity management
- Permission frameworks
- Usage tracking
- Security protocols

**Data Formats**:
- Standardized schemas
- Semantic markup
- Structured outputs
- Version control

### Examples of Agent-Ready Services

**Web Services**:
- RESTful APIs with clear documentation
- GraphQL endpoints for flexible queries
- Webhook systems for real-time updates

**Data Providers**:
- Structured data feeds
- Real-time streaming APIs
- Semantic web standards

**Tool Integrations**:
- Function calling interfaces
- Plugin architectures
- Workflow orchestration

## Conclusion: Embracing the Transformation

Andrej Karpathy's vision of software evolution represents a fundamental shift in how we think about programming and application development. The coexistence of three programming paradigmsâ€”traditional code, neural networks, and natural languageâ€”creates unprecedented opportunities and challenges.

The key insight is that this isn't about replacement but about augmentation and collaboration. Traditional programming skills remain valuable while new capabilities emerge. The most successful developers and organizations will be those who can effectively combine all three paradigms.

As we build the infrastructure for AI agents and develop partially autonomous applications, we're not just creating new toolsâ€”we're reshaping the entire software landscape. The future belongs to those who can navigate this complexity while maintaining focus on human needs and values.

The era of programming in English has begun, but it's not the end of programming as we know itâ€”it's the beginning of a new chapter where technology becomes more accessible, more powerful, and more aligned with human communication patterns.
