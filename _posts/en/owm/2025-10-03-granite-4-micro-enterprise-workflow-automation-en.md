            }
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "create_support_ticket",
            "description": "Generate support ticket in helpdesk system",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "priority": {"type": "string", "enum": ["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]},
                    "category": {"type": "string", "description": "Issue category"},
                    "description": {"type": "string", "description": "Detailed issue description"}
                },
                "required": ["priority", "category", "description"]
