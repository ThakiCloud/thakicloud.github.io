## Introduction

The field of large language models has witnessed another groundbreaking advancement with the release of Ring-flash-2.0 by inclusionAI. This innovative thinking model represents a significant leap forward in Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining exceptional performance with remarkable efficiency. Built upon the foundation of Ling-flash-2.0-base, Ring-flash-2.0 introduces revolutionary training methodologies and architectural optimizations that set new standards for complex reasoning tasks.

What makes Ring-flash-2.0 particularly noteworthy is its ability to deliver performance comparable to much larger models while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency. With 100 billion total parameters but only 6.1 billion activated per inference, this model demonstrates how intelligent architecture design can achieve outstanding results without proportional resource consumption.

## Model Architecture and Specifications

### Core Architecture Design

Ring-flash-2.0 employs a sophisticated MoE architecture that represents the evolution of the Ling 2.0 series. The model's design philosophy centers around maximizing performance while minimizing computational overhead through several key architectural innovations:

**Parameter Configuration:**
- Total parameters: 100 billion
- Activated parameters per inference: 6.1 billion (4.8B non-embedding)
- Expert activation ratio: 1/32
- Integration of MTP (Mixture of Tensor Parallelism) layers

The model's architecture achieves a remarkable balance between capacity and efficiency. By activating only 6.1% of its total parameters during inference, Ring-flash-2.0 delivers performance comparable to dense models with approximately 40 billion parameters while maintaining significantly faster inference speeds.

### Efficiency Optimizations

The structural optimizations implemented in Ring-flash-2.0 enable exceptional inference performance. When deployed on just four H20 GPUs, the model achieves generation speeds exceeding 200 tokens per second. This high-speed inference capability makes Ring-flash-2.0 particularly suitable for high-concurrency scenarios where traditional thinking models might face scalability challenges.

The low activation ratio combined with high sparsity design significantly reduces the computational burden during inference, making advanced reasoning capabilities more accessible for real-world applications. This efficiency breakthrough addresses one of the primary concerns in deploying large-scale thinking models in production environments.

## The Revolutionary IcePop Algorithm

### Addressing Training-Inference Gaps

One of the most significant contributions of Ring-flash-2.0 is the introduction of the IcePop algorithm, which addresses critical challenges in reinforcement learning for MoE models. Traditional RL approaches for MoE architectures face substantial difficulties due to precision discrepancies between training and inference phases, particularly as sequence lengths and training steps increase.

The core problem that IcePop solves relates to the progressive widening of gaps between training and inference precision. In conventional approaches, when the relative difference between training and inference probabilities for the same token exceeds 5%, the training process effectively fails. This limitation has historically posed significant challenges for long-horizon reinforcement learning with lengthy sequences.

### Distribution Calibration Mechanism

IcePop introduces an innovative solution through distribution calibration via masked bidirectional truncation. This approach effectively narrows the gap between training and inference phases through two key mechanisms:

**Bidirectional Truncation:**
The algorithm performs sophisticated truncation operations that address both scenarios where training probability significantly exceeds inference probability and the reverse situation where training probability falls substantially below inference probability. This bidirectional approach ensures balanced optimization across different probability distributions.

**Masking Strategy:**
Tokens exhibiting excessively large discrepancies between training and inference phases are strategically excluded from gradient computation. This selective masking prevents unstable gradients from destabilizing the training process while maintaining learning efficiency for well-aligned tokens.

The IcePop algorithm represents a fundamental advancement in making RL training stable and effective for MoE architectures, enabling sustained improvement in complex reasoning capabilities throughout extended training cycles.

## Multi-Stage Training Pipeline

### Comprehensive Training Methodology

Ring-flash-2.0 employs a sophisticated multi-stage training pipeline designed to comprehensively enhance the model's capabilities across different domains. The training process consists of three distinct phases, each targeting specific aspects of model performance:

**Phase 1: Long-CoT SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)**
The initial phase focuses on equipping the base Ling-flash-2.0 model with diverse thinking patterns through lightweight Long-Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning. This foundation phase establishes the model's reasoning framework and prepares it for more advanced training stages.

**Phase 2: RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards)**
The second phase implements reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to continuously stimulate and enhance the model's reasoning potential. This stage focuses on developing robust reasoning capabilities that can be objectively evaluated and improved through reward-based optimization.

**Phase 3: RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**
The final phase incorporates human feedback to refine the model's general abilities and ensure alignment with human preferences and expectations. This stage balances the model's enhanced reasoning capabilities with practical usability and safety considerations.

### Training Strategy Optimization

During the development process, the team compared joint training approaches that combined RLVR and RLHF with the ultimately adopted two-staged RL pipeline. While both methodologies demonstrated similar effectiveness in experimental settings, the two-staged approach proved superior from an engineering efficiency perspective.

The differing difficulty levels between RLVR and RLHF tasks created challenges in joint training scenarios. RLHF tasks typically involve shorter model rollouts compared to RLVR tasks, leading to more long-tail generations during joint training. The two-staged approach addresses these challenges by allowing each training phase to focus on its specific objectives without interference from conflicting optimization signals.
