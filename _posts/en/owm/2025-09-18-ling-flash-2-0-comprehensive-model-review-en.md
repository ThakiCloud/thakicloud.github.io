git clone -b v0.10.0 https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git
cd vllm
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inclusionAI/Ling-V2/refs/heads/main/inference/vllm/bailing_moe_v2.patch
git apply bailing_moe_v2.patch
pip install -e .
```

#### Offline Inference Example
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("inclusionAI/Ling-flash-2.0")
sampling_params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0.7, 
    top_p=0.8, 
    repetition_penalty=1.05, 
    max_tokens=16384
)

llm = LLM(model="inclusionAI/Ling-flash-2.0", dtype='bfloat16')
prompt = "Explain quantum computing principles"
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Ling, an assistant created by inclusionAI"},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
outputs = llm.generate([text], sampling_params)
```

#### Online API Service
```bash
vllm serve inclusionAI/Ling-flash-2.0 \
    --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
    --pipeline-parallel-size 1 \
    --use-v2-block-manager \
    --gpu-memory-utilization 0.90
```

pip3 install sglang==0.5.2rc0 sgl-kernel==0.3.7.post1

# Apply the patch
patch -d `python -c 'import sglang;import os; print(os.path.dirname(sglang.__file__))'` -p3 < inference/sglang/bailing_moe_v2.patch

# Start server
python -m sglang.launch_server \
    --model-path $MODEL_PATH \
    --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT \
    --trust-remote-code \

```

## Practical Implementation Guide

### Basic Usage with Transformers

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "inclusionAI/Ling-flash-2.0"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True,
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

prompt = "Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform"
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Ling, an assistant created by inclusionAI"},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt", return_token_type_ids=False).to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=512
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)
```

### Long Context Handling

For applications requiring extended context windows, enable YaRN extrapolation:

```json
{
  "rope_scaling": {
    "factor": 4.0,
    "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768,
    "type": "yarn"
