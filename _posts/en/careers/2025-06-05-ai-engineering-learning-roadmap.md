## Learning Guide

This roadmap comprehensively covers various areas of AI engineering. Each section can be learned independently, and you can adjust the learning order according to your interests and goals.

### Recommended Learning Order

1. Coding & ML Fundamentals: First learn programming and machine learning concepts that form the foundation of AI engineering.
2. LLM APIs: Learn basic usage of large language models.
3. Model Adaptation: Learn how to adjust models through prompt engineering and fine-tuning.
4. Storage & RAG: Learn how to build data storage and retrieval systems.
5. AI Agents: Learn how to design and implement autonomous AI agents.
6. Infrastructure & Security: Consider deployment and security in production environments.

### Learning Tips

- Try implementing the practical examples from each section yourself.
- Participate in relevant communities to share experiences with other developers.
- Continuously update with the latest trends and technologies.

We hope this roadmap helps you start your journey in AI engineering. Please proceed with learning at your own pace and according to your interests.
