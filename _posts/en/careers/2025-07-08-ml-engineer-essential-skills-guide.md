## Introduction

As the importance of AI/ML technology rapidly increases in modern enterprises, there is an explosive demand for engineers who can go beyond simply creating models to **build ML systems that actually work in production environments**.

The [Made-With-ML](https://github.com/GokuMohandas/Made-With-ML) project, which has received 40.6k stars on GitHub, provides a practical ML engineering guide that reflects this reality. This post is a hiring guide that outlines **the essential competencies that ML engineers should possess in our company** based on the core content of that project.
