## Why Talk About Hiring Criteria Through a 'Book List'?

We value **problem-solving attitude** and **learning depth** more than experience.  
The experience of reading a book to the end, applying it to practice, and even explaining it to colleagues proves sustainable competency in itself.  
That's why we consider the following ten books as **basic literacy for backend·infrastructure engineers**.

---

## 1. 《Clean Code》

* **Author** — Robert C. Martin  
* **Key Keywords** — Readability, Refactoring, Naming  
* **Why We Value It**  
  1. **Long-term Maintenance** — Even startups quickly develop legacy code. Clean code reduces costs.  
  2. **Team Communication** — Good naming and function division serve as documentation. Enables communication faster than words.  
  3. **Refactoring Habits** — The habit of making small improvements with test code enhances service stability.

---

## 2. 《Head First Design Patterns (2nd)》

* **Author** — Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson  
* **Key Keywords** — Object-oriented, SOLID, Reusability  
* **Why We Value It**  
  1. **Pattern Language** — Conversations like "Should we switch to the strategy pattern?" become possible, speeding up collaboration.  
  2. **Extensible Design** — When requirements grow, you can 'extend' code rather than 'overhaul' it.  
  3. **Visual Learning** — Pictures and interactive examples lower the learning curve.

---

## 3. 《Designing Data-Intensive Applications》

* **Author** — Martin Kleppmann  
* **Key Keywords** — Distributed Systems, CAP, Event Sourcing  
* **Why We Value It**  
  1. **Scale Perspective** — Enables evidence-based decisions like "Should we add some read latency to improve consistency?"  
  2. **Data Pipelines** — Understanding CDC·stream·batch boundary conditions.  
  3. **Trade-off Thinking** — Scientifically finding the balance point between performance·stability·complexity.

---

## 4. 《Building Microservices (2nd)》

* **Author** — Sam Newman  
* **Key Keywords** — Domain Decomposition, CI/CD, Observability  
* **Why We Value It**  
  1. **Domain-Driven Decomposition** — Making evidence-based judgments on 'when' to split monoliths.  
  2. **Observability** — Reducing failure recovery time through integrated logs·metrics·tracing.  
  3. **Team Topology** — Developing the perspective to design organizational and service structures together.

---

## 5. 《Designing Web APIs》

* **Author** — Brenda Jin, Saurabh Sahni & Amir Shevat  
* **Key Keywords** — REST, OpenAPI, DX  
* **Why We Value It**  
  1. **Contract-First** — OpenAPI-based design allows all client teams to run simultaneously.  
  2. **Versioning Strategy** — Exposing new features without breaking compatibility.  
  3. **DX** — Accelerating partner onboarding through automated documentation·sandbox·example code.

---

## 6. 《System Design Interview Vol. 2》

* **Author** — Alex Xu, Sahn Lam / **Translator** — Lee Byung-jun  
* **Key Keywords** — Large-scale System Design, Interviews, Trade-offs  
* **Why We Value It**  
  1. **Problem Decomposition** — Quickly structuring requirements with flowcharts·diagrams.  
  2. **Trade-off Communication** — Persuading CAP·PACELC choices through 'words'.  
  3. **Practical Interview Sense** — Training to immediately set priorities under constraints.

---

## 7. 《Infrastructure Engineer's Textbook》

* **Author** — Sano Yutaka / **Translator** — Kim Sung-jae  
* **Key Keywords** — Server, Network, Virtualization, Operations  
* **Why We Value It**  
  1. **Full-stack Infrastructure Understanding** — Physical·virtual·cloud layers come into view at a glance.  
  2. **Operations Optimization** — Systematic approach to incident response·root cause analysis (RCA).  
  3. **MSP Perspective** — Developing multi-tenant·SLA design sensibility.

---

## 8. 《Software Engineering at Google》

* **Author** — Titus Winters, Tom Manshreck, Hyrum Wright / **Translator** — 개앞맵시  
* **Key Keywords** — Large-scale Codebase, Review, Automation  
* **Why We Value It**  
  1. **Code Health** — Learning principles and cases of 'sustainable code'.  
  2. **Review Culture** — Presenting methods for practicing consensus-based quality management.  
  3. **Engineering Process** — Understanding the productivity tool philosophy that led from Borg → Kubernetes.

---

## 9. 《Easy Kubernetes for Developers》

* **Author** — William Denniss / **Translator** — Lee Jun  
* **Key Keywords** — Kubernetes, Deployment, Scalability  
* **Why We Value It**  
  1. **Practical Guide** — Kubernetes objects and YAML writing become 'immediately' familiar.  
  2. **Operations Automation** — Building stable services with rolling updates·health checks·HPA.  
  3. **Cloud-Native Thinking** — Naturally acquiring the concept of 'immutable infrastructure'.

---

## 10. 《CUDA-based GPU Parallel Processing》

* **Author** — Kim Deok-su  
* **Key Keywords** — CUDA, Parallel Programming, Optimization  
* **Why We Value It**  
  1. **Performance Sense** — Experiencing memory coalescing·thread warps through hand-coding.  
  2. **AI Infrastructure** — Directly resolving bottlenecks in large-scale model training·inference pipelines.  
  3. **GPU Architecture Understanding** — Depth that digs down to SM·Tensor Core level becomes competitive advantage.
