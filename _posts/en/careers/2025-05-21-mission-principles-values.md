Thaki Cloud aims to contribute to society by enabling people to beneficially use the innovations brought by technology.

# 🎯 Mission

## 💛 We Love Our Customers

We strive to understand, anticipate, and exceed our customers' needs. Based on deep relationships, we provide practical solutions, and our mission **starts with empathy and is completed with continuous impact**.

## 😄 Enjoy the Process of Work

We believe that enjoying the journey is **the key to innovation and success**. A positive and pleasant culture stimulates creativity, encourages new challenges, and makes our team stronger.

## 🎯 Align Company Goals with Personal Growth

Our growth is achieved together. Every member's **personal and professional growth** should contribute to the company's success, and vice versa. This alignment **ensures purpose, motivation, and continuous value for all members**.

# 📌 Principles

## 🧭 Integrity and Honesty

We always act honestly and choose to do the right thing even when it's difficult. We value **long-term trust** over short-term results and maintain **transparency and integrity** in relationships with customers, partners, and colleagues.

## 💪 Responsibility

Every member takes **complete responsibility** for their actions and decisions. When problems arise, we don't avoid responsibility but step forward to solve them. The results we create reflect ourselves, and we have **pride and responsibility** for them.

## 🌍 Keep External Technology Open (Avoid NIH Syndrome)

Great technology exists outside of us too. We avoid the **"Not Invented Here"** attitude and actively embrace external ideas and solutions. What matters is not who created it, but **providing the best results to customers**.

# 🌟 Values

## ⚡ Speed

We move fast, learn fast, and improve fast. **Speed is competitiveness**, and we believe it's **better to act and adjust than to stop pursuing perfection**.

## 🧠 Precise and Swift Solutions

We clearly identify problems and solve them **accurately and swiftly**. Solving quickly doesn't mean doing it carelessly, but **identifying root causes and responding carefully**.

## 🙋 Responsible Attitude

We take **complete responsibility** for our work, decisions, and their consequences. Being a **trusted team member** means being someone who **contributes to the success of the entire team**, not just ourselves.

## 😂 Sense of Humor

We take our work seriously, but **don't take ourselves too seriously**. Humor makes us more human, connects the team, and helps us maintain resilience even in difficult moments.

## 🌱 Sustainability

We design systems, relationships, and habits to be **sustainable for the long term**. We prevent burnout and pursue **sustainable growth and choices** from a long-term perspective.

## 🔧 Action Over Words

We believe that **action is more important than words**. A culture that **shows results rather than fancy words** is how we work.
