```mermaid
graph LR
    A[chat.go] --> B[read.go]
    B --> C[list_files.go]
    C --> D[bash_tool.go]
    D --> E[edit_tool.go]
    E --> F[code_search_tool.go]
    
    A --> A1[Basic Chat]

    C --> C1[Directory Listing]
    D --> D1[Command Execution]
    E --> E1[File Editing]
    F --> F1[Code Search]
```

## Phase 1: Basic Chat Agent (chat.go)

### Core Architecture

The foundation starts with a simple chat interface that establishes the conversation loop pattern:

```go
type Agent struct {
    client      *anthropic.Client
    getUserMessage func() (string, bool)
    tools       []ToolDefinition
    verbose     bool
}
```

### Key Learning Points

- **API Integration**: Direct connection to Anthropic Claude API
- **Conversation Management**: Maintaining chat history and context
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for API calls
- **User Interface**: Terminal-based interaction patterns

### Implementation Highlights

The chat agent demonstrates:
- Streaming responses for real-time interaction
- Conversation state management
- Basic error recovery mechanisms
- Logging and debugging capabilities

## Phase 2: File Reading Agent (read.go)

### Tool Integration Foundation

This phase introduces the tool system that becomes central to all subsequent agents:

```go
type ToolDefinition struct {
    Name        string
    Description string
    InputSchema ToolInputSchemaParam
    Function    func(input json.RawMessage) (string, error)
}
```

### Read File Tool Implementation

```go
type ReadFileInput struct {
    Path string `json:"path" jsonschema:"description=File path to read"`
}

func ReadFile(input json.RawMessage) (string, error) {
    var params ReadFileInput
    if err := json.Unmarshal(input, &params); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    
    content, err := os.ReadFile(params.Path)
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to read file: %w", err)
    }
    
    return string(content), nil
}
```

### Tool Registration Pattern

The workshop establishes a consistent pattern for tool registration:

```go
var readFileTool = ToolDefinition{
    Name:        "read_file",
    Description: "Read the contents of a file",
    InputSchema: GenerateSchema[ReadFileInput](),
    Function:    ReadFile,
}
```

## Phase 3: File System Navigation (list_files.go)

### Directory Operations

Building on file reading, this phase adds directory traversal capabilities:

```go
type ListFilesInput struct {
    Path string `json:"path" jsonschema:"description=Directory path to list"`
}
```

### Enhanced File Management

The list files tool provides:
- Recursive directory scanning
- File type filtering
- Path normalization
- Error handling for permissions and access issues

### Multi-Tool Coordination

This phase demonstrates how multiple tools work together:
- `read_file` for content access
- `list_files` for discovery
- Coordinated operations for complex tasks

## Phase 4: System Integration (bash_tool.go)

### Command Execution Capabilities

The bash tool introduces system-level operations:

```go
type BashInput struct {
    Command string `json:"command" jsonschema:"description=Bash command to execute"`
}

func BashCommand(input json.RawMessage) (string, error) {
    var params BashInput
    if err := json.Unmarshal(input, &params); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    
    cmd := exec.Command("bash", "-c", params.Command)
    output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
    
    return string(output), err
}
```

### Safety and Security Considerations

The workshop addresses critical security aspects:
- Command validation and sanitization
- Output capture and error handling
- Process management and timeouts
- Permission and access controls

### Real-World Applications

With command execution, the agent can:
- Run build processes and tests
- Install dependencies and packages
- Execute git operations
- Perform system diagnostics

## Phase 5: Code Editing (edit_tool.go)

### File Modification Engine

The edit tool represents a significant capability leap:

```go
type EditFileInput struct {
    Path   string `json:"path" jsonschema:"description=File path to edit"`
    OldStr string `json:"old_str" jsonschema:"description=String to replace"`
    NewStr string `json:"new_str" jsonschema:"description=Replacement string"`
}
```

### Validation and Safety

The edit tool implements several safety mechanisms:
- Content validation before modification
- Backup creation for rollback capability
- Atomic operations to prevent partial edits
- Diff generation for change tracking

### Advanced Editing Features

```go
type CodeSearchInput struct {
    Pattern       string `json:"pattern" jsonschema:"description=Search pattern"`
    Path          string `json:"path,omitempty" jsonschema:"description=Search path"`
    FileType      string `json:"file_type,omitempty" jsonschema:"description=File type filter"`
    CaseSensitive bool   `json:"case_sensitive,omitempty" jsonschema:"description=Case sensitive search"`
}
```

### Advanced Search Capabilities
