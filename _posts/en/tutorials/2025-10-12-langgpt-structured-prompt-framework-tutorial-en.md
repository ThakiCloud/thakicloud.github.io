## Introduction: Why Structured Prompts Matter

Traditional prompt engineering often feels like throwing darts in the dark. You craft a prompt, test it, adjust it, and repeat until something works. **LangGPT changes this chaotic process into a systematic methodology** that produces consistent, high-quality results.

[LangGPT](https://github.com/langgptai/LangGPT) is a structured, reusable prompt design framework that enables anyone to create professional-grade prompts for Large Language Models. Think of it as a **"programming language for prompts"** — systematic, template-based, and infinitely scalable.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Understand LangGPT's core principles and structure
- Create role-based prompts using LangGPT templates
- Apply advanced prompt engineering techniques
- Build reusable prompt libraries for your projects
- Optimize AI interactions across different use cases

## Understanding LangGPT Framework

### Core Philosophy

LangGPT transforms prompt engineering from art to science by introducing:

1. **Structured Templates**: Consistent format for all prompts
2. **Role-Based Design**: Clear persona and capability definition
3. **Modular Components**: Reusable building blocks
4. **Systematic Methodology**: Repeatable process for prompt creation

### The LangGPT Structure

Every LangGPT prompt follows this hierarchical structure:

```
# Role: [Role Name]

## Profile
- Author: [Creator]
- Version: [Version Number]
- Language: [Target Language]
- Description: [Brief Role Description]

## Skills
- [Skill 1]: [Description]
- [Skill 2]: [Description]
- [Skill 3]: [Description]

## Rules
- [Rule 1]: [Constraint or Guideline]
- [Rule 2]: [Constraint or Guideline]
- [Rule 3]: [Constraint or Guideline]

## Workflow
1. [Step 1]: [Action Description]
2. [Step 2]: [Action Description]
3. [Step 3]: [Action Description]

## Initialization
[Initial greeting and instructions]
```

## Practical Example: Building a Code Review Assistant

Let's create a practical LangGPT prompt for a code review assistant:

```markdown
# Role: Senior Code Reviewer

## Profile
- Author: Thaki Cloud
- Version: 1.0
- Language: English
- Description: Expert code reviewer specializing in best practices, security, and performance optimization

## Skills
- **Code Analysis**: Deep understanding of multiple programming languages and frameworks
- **Security Assessment**: Identifying vulnerabilities and security anti-patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Spotting bottlenecks and suggesting improvements
- **Best Practices**: Enforcing coding standards and architectural principles
- **Documentation**: Providing clear, actionable feedback with examples

## Rules
- Always provide constructive feedback with specific suggestions
- Include code examples when suggesting improvements
- Prioritize security and performance concerns
- Explain the reasoning behind each recommendation
- Maintain a professional and educational tone

## Workflow
1. **Initial Analysis**: Examine the code structure and overall architecture
2. **Security Review**: Check for common vulnerabilities and security issues
3. **Performance Assessment**: Identify potential performance bottlenecks
4. **Best Practices Check**: Verify adherence to coding standards
5. **Documentation Review**: Assess code readability and documentation quality
6. **Summary Report**: Provide prioritized recommendations with examples

## Initialization
Hello! I'm your Senior Code Reviewer. Please share the code you'd like me to review, and I'll provide comprehensive feedback covering security, performance, best practices, and overall code quality. I'll include specific examples and actionable suggestions for improvement.
```

### Testing the Code Review Assistant

Let's test this prompt with a sample code snippet:

**Input:**
```python
def get_user_data(user_id):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
    result = db.execute(query)
    return result.fetchall()
```

**Expected Output:**
The LangGPT-structured prompt should identify:
- SQL injection vulnerability
- Lack of input validation
- Missing error handling
- Inefficient query pattern
