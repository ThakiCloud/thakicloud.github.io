3. **Set Up Logging**: Log files will be stored for troubleshooting

**Important**: The initial model download requires a stable internet connection and may take 30-60 minutes depending on your connection speed.

## Step-by-Step Transcription Guide

### Step 1: Audio File Selection

1. **Launch noScribe** and click the "Browse" button
2. **Select your audio file** - supported formats include:
   - MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC
   - Video files (MP4, AVI) - audio will be extracted
3. **Verify file path** appears correctly in the input field

### Step 2: Output Configuration

1. **Choose output location** by clicking "Browse" next to the output field
2. **Select file format**:
   - **HTML** (recommended): Compatible with word processors and QDA software
   - **Text**: Plain text format
   - **SRT**: Subtitle format with timestamps

### Step 3: Transcription Settings

#### Audio Processing Options

**Start/Stop Times**:
- Leave blank to transcribe entire file
- Set specific time ranges for long recordings
- Format: HH:MM:SS (e.g., 00:05:30 for 5 minutes 30 seconds)

**Quality Settings**:
- **Precise** (recommended): Highest accuracy, slower processing
- **Fast**: Quicker results, may require more manual editing
- **Custom Models**: Advanced users can install specialized models

#### Advanced Features

**Mark Pause**:
- **1sec+**: Mark pauses of 1 second or longer
- **2sec+**: Mark pauses of 2 seconds or longer  
- **3sec+**: Mark only longer pauses
- **None**: Disable pause detection

Pauses appear as:
- Short pauses: `(..)` (dots represent seconds)
- Long pauses: `(XX seconds pause)` or `(XX minutes pause)`

**Speaker Detection**:
- **Auto**: Automatically detect number of speakers
- **Specific Number**: Set if you know exact speaker count
- **None**: Disable speaker identification (faster processing)

**Additional Options**:
- **Overlapping Speech**: Mark simultaneous speech with `//double slashes//`
- **Disfluencies**: Include "um", "uh", and incomplete words
- **Timestamps**: Add `[hh:mm:ss]` markers at speaker changes or intervals

### Step 4: Processing

1. **Review all settings** before starting
2. **Click "Start"** to begin transcription
3. **Monitor progress** via the progress bar and log messages
4. **Processing time**: Expect 2-3x the audio length (1-hour audio = 2-3 hours processing)

**Performance Tips**:
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use AC power (not battery)
- Avoid heavy system usage during processing
- Consider processing overnight for long files

## Optimizing Transcription Quality

### Audio Recording Best Practices

**Before Recording**:
- Use quality microphones (external preferred over built-in)
- Choose quiet environments with minimal echo
- Test audio levels before important recordings
- Consider using lapel mics for multiple speakers

**Recording Settings**:
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz or higher
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit minimum, 24-bit preferred
- **Format**: Uncompressed (WAV) or high-quality compressed (320kbps MP3)

### Language Considerations

**Best Supported Languages**:
1. English
2. Spanish
3. Italian
4. Portuguese
5. German

**Dialect Handling**:
- Whisper handles regional accents reasonably well
- Swiss German, British English, American English all supported
- Expect more manual corrections for less common dialects

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Repetitive Text Loops**:
- **Cause**: AI gets stuck repeating phrases
- **Solution**: Process shorter segments (15-30 minutes)
- **Prevention**: Ensure good audio quality

**Poor Speaker Separation**:
- **Cause**: Similar voices or poor audio quality
- **Solution**: Manual speaker correction in editor
- **Alternative**: Disable speaker detection, add manually

**Hallucinations**:
- **Cause**: AI interprets background noise as speech
- **Solution**: Use noise reduction before transcription
- **Identification**: Look for nonsensical text in quiet sections

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Settings

Access advanced options through `config.yml` in your user directory:

**Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\noScribe\noScribe\config.yml`
**Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/noscribe/config.yml`
**Linux**: `~/.config/noscribe/config.yml`

```yaml
# Example configuration
locale: en  # Interface language
whisper_model: medium  # Model size
output_format: html
enable_logging: true
max_segment_length: 30  # seconds
```

### Custom Whisper Models

For specialized use cases, you can install custom models:

1. **Download custom model** (e.g., fine-tuned for medical terminology)
2. **Place in models directory** within noScribe installation
3. **Update configuration** to reference custom model
4. **Restart application** to load new model

### Batch Processing

For multiple files, consider creating scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Batch transcription script
for file in *.mp3; do
    python noScribe.py --input "$file" --output "${file%.mp3}.html" --auto
done
```
