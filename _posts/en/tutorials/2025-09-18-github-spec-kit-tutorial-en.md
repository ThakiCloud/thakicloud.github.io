### Why this tutorial
Spec‑Driven Development helps teams focus on product scenarios first, then drive code from those specs. GitHub’s Spec Kit provides opinionated templates, scripts, and checklists to speed this up. In this guide, you will take a feature from idea to baseline spec, refine it, generate a plan, validate it, and prepare for implementation—end to end on macOS.

Reference: [GitHub Spec Kit repository](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) [cited: `http://github.com/github/spec-kit`]

---

## 1) Prerequisites
- macOS 13+ (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- Git 2.40+
- Node.js 18+ or 20+ (optional if you script helper tasks)
- Python 3.10+ (Spec Kit repo uses Python; not required to consume templates)
- A GitHub account and SSH configured (optional but recommended)

Quick checks:
```bash
# Git
git --version
# Python
python3 --version
# Node (optional)
node -v
```

---

## 2) Get the Spec Kit templates locally
You can consume the templates directly or fork/clone for faster iteration.

```bash
# 1) Clone the Spec Kit repository (read-only)
git clone https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
cd spec-kit

# 2) Explore key folders
ls -la templates/  # plan-template.md, spec-template.md, tasks-template.md
ls -la docs/       # guidance & examples
```

Tip: Keep `templates/` handy; you’ll reuse them in every feature.

---

## 3) Create a new feature workspace
We’ll scaffold a local project folder that mirrors the structure recommended in the repo.

```bash
# Replace FEATURE_SLUG with your feature, e.g., taskify
FEATURE_SLUG=taskify
mkdir -p features/${FEATURE_SLUG}
cd features/${FEATURE_SLUG}

# Copy templates to your feature directory
cp ../../spec-kit/templates/spec-template.md ./spec.md
cp ../../spec-kit/templates/plan-template.md ./plan.md
cp ../../spec-kit/templates/tasks-template.md ./tasks.md
```

Folder layout now:
```bash
.
├── plan.md
├── spec.md
└── tasks.md
```

---

## 4) STEP 1 — Generate the baseline spec
Use your editor or an AI coding assistant to fill the baseline `spec.md` with product scenarios, user stories, and acceptance criteria. If you follow Spec Kit’s flow, you’ll start with a concise PRD-like description.

Suggested prompt for your assistant:
```text
You are writing a baseline feature spec for a small app called Taskify.
Include goals, non-goals, primary personas, user journeys, and acceptance criteria.
Add a "Review & Acceptance Checklist" at the end with clear checkable items.
Limit the initial scope to one release-sized feature.
```

What “good” looks like:
- Clear goals/non-goals
- A small number of high-signal user journeys
- Testable acceptance criteria
- A review checklist with objective checks

---

## 5) STEP 2 — Clarify the functional specification
Read through your baseline `spec.md` and refine.

Examples of clarifications:
- Constrain variable ranges (e.g., 5–15 tasks per sample project; at least one per status)
- Tighten error states and empty-state UX
- Define metrics (latency budgets, success criteria)

Helpful prompt:
```text
Read the review and acceptance checklist in spec.md and check off the items that pass.
Leave unchecked any items that aren’t satisfied yet and explain why in one sentence each.
```

Outcome: `spec.md` is sharper, with open items explicitly listed.

---

## 6) STEP 3 — Generate the technical plan
Create and iterate on `plan.md` using your chosen stack. Example (from the Spec Kit README’s suggested flow):

```text
We will build with .NET Aspire and Postgres. Frontend: Blazor Server with
realtime task boards. APIs: Projects, Tasks, Notifications.
Produce data-model.md, contracts (api-spec.json, signalr-spec.md), quickstart.md.
```

Embed links to specific implementation details and sequence the plan into executable steps. Cross-check “research.md” if your stack is fast-moving.

---

## 7) STEP 4 — Validate the plan
Before you implement, perform a plan audit:
- Are all core tasks ordered and reference their specs/contracts?
- Are “unknowns” captured as research todos?
- Are non-functional requirements testable?

Helpful prompt:
```text
Audit plan.md and linked docs for gaps. Create a numbered sequence of
implementation tasks with references to plan/spec sections. Identify any
over-engineered parts and propose simplifications.
```

---

## 8) STEP 5 — Prepare for implementation
At this point, you can:
- Open a feature branch and draft PR back to `main`
- Wire up scaffolding scripts (create directories, seed configs)
- Land “empty” contracts and data models to enable early review

Minimal script example to scaffold a dotnet/Node hybrid (adjust to your stack):
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)
mkdir -p src/api src/web docs contracts

echo "{}" > contracts/api-spec.json
cat > docs/quickstart.md <<'MD'
# Quickstart
1. Install dependencies
2. Run the API and Web
3. Open http://localhost:3000
MD

echo "Scaffold complete at ${PROJECT_ROOT}"
```

---

## 9) macOS test script (runnable)
The following script checks your local environment, confirms template presence, and prepares a feature area. It is safe to run multiple times.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# file: scripts/spec-kit-smoke-test.sh
set -euo pipefail

# 1) Basic tooling
command -v git >/dev/null || { echo "git missing"; exit 1; }
command -v python3 >/dev/null || { echo "python3 missing"; exit 1; }

# 2) Repo presence
if [ ! -d "spec-kit/templates" ]; then
  echo "Spec Kit templates not found. Cloning..."
  rm -rf spec-kit
  git clone https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
fi

# 3) Feature workspace
FEATURE=${1:-taskify}
mkdir -p features/${FEATURE}
cp -f spec-kit/templates/spec-template.md features/${FEATURE}/spec.md
cp -f spec-kit/templates/plan-template.md features/${FEATURE}/plan.md
cp -f spec-kit/templates/tasks-template.md features/${FEATURE}/tasks.md

# 4) Report
ls -la features/${FEATURE}
echo "OK: feature workspace ready"
```

Expected output (abridged):
```text
cloning into 'spec-kit'...
spec-template.md  plan-template.md  tasks-template.md
OK: feature workspace ready
```

---

## 10) Troubleshooting notes
From the official repo guidance:
- Use the assistant to iterate. Do not treat the first attempt as final.
- Validate the Review & Acceptance Checklist before moving on.
- Watch for over‑engineering; simplify where possible.

If Git credentials fail on Linux, the README suggests installing Git Credential Manager; see the sample script in the repository’s troubleshooting section. Source: [Spec Kit README](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) [cited: `http://github.com/github/spec-kit`]

---

## 11) Next steps
- Extend `tasks.md` into granular, reviewable work items
- Open a draft PR early and keep specs in the same branch for review
- Keep refining specs as implementation reveals new details
