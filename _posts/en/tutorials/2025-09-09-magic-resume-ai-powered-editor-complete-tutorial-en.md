Let's verify your setup:

```bash

pnpm --version

# Check Git version
git --version
```

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the Magic Resume repository
git clone https://github.com/JOYCEQL/magic-resume.git

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
# Start the development server

```

Your Magic Resume application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing the Installation

Let's create a simple test script to verify everything works correctly:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: test-magic-resume.sh

echo "üß™ Testing Magic Resume Installation..."

# Check if the development server starts
echo "Starting development server..."
timeout 30 pnpm dev &
DEV_PID=$!

# Wait for server to start
sleep 10

# Check if the server is responding
if curl -s http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null; then
    echo "‚úÖ Development server is running successfully!"
else
    echo "‚ùå Development server failed to start"
    exit 1
fi

# Clean up
kill $DEV_PID
echo "üéâ Magic Resume installation test completed!"
```

Make the script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x test-magic-resume.sh
./test-magic-resume.sh
```
