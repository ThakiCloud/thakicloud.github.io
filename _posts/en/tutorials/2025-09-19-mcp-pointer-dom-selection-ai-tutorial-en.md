3. **Ask your AI assistant**: "What element did I select?"
4. Your AI should respond with detailed information about the targeted element

## Practical Usage Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing a Button Component

**Scenario**: You want to understand the styling and structure of a call-to-action button on a website.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the target webpage
2. **Option+Click** the button you want to analyze
3. Ask your AI: *"Analyze the button I just selected. What CSS classes and styles are applied?"*

**Expected AI Response**:
```
The button you selected has the following properties:

**Element**: <button class="btn btn-primary cta-button">
**Text Content**: "Get Started Now"
**CSS Classes**: btn, btn-primary, cta-button
**Key Styles**:
- Background: #007bff (primary blue)
- Padding: 12px 24px
- Border-radius: 6px
- Font-weight: 600
- Position: relative at (450, 320)

**Styling Analysis**: This appears to be a Bootstrap-styled primary button with custom CTA modifications for enhanced visual prominence.
```

### Example 2: React Component Investigation

**Scenario**: You need to understand a complex React component's structure and find its source file.

**Steps**:
1. **Option+Click** the React component
2. Ask: *"What React component is this and where can I find its source code?"*

**Expected AI Response**:
```
**React Component Detected**: ProductCard
**Component Props**: {title: "Premium Plan", price: 99, featured: true}
**Source Location**: src/components/ProductCard/ProductCard.tsx
**Component Tree**: App ‚Üí PricingPage ‚Üí ProductGrid ‚Üí ProductCard

This component appears to be a reusable pricing card with conditional "featured" styling. The source suggests it's part of a modular pricing system.
```

### Example 3: Debugging CSS Layout Issues

**Scenario**: You're experiencing unexpected layout behavior and need to understand the CSS cascade.

**Steps**:
1. **Option+Click** the problematic element
2. Ask: *"Why is this element positioned differently than expected? Show me the computed styles."*

**Expected AI Response**:
```
**Layout Analysis for Selected Element**:

**Position**: absolute (top: 50px, left: 200px)
**Display**: flex with justify-content: space-between
**Box Model**: 
- Width: 320px (specified)
- Height: 180px (computed)
- Margin: 16px auto
- Padding: 20px

**Potential Issue**: The element has `position: absolute` which removes it from normal document flow. The `margin: auto` won't center it as expected. Consider using `transform: translateX(-50%)` with `left: 50%` for proper centering.
```
