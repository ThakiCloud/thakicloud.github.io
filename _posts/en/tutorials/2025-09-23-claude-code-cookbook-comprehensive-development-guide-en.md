## What is Claude Code Cookbook?

### Overview

Claude Code Cookbook is a curated collection of commands, roles, and automation scripts designed to enhance Claude Code's capabilities for software development. Originally forked from wasabeef's repository and enhanced by the community, it provides a systematic approach to integrating AI into your development workflow.

### Key Components

The toolkit consists of three main components:

1. **Commands**: Over 60 specialized commands for specific development tasks
2. **Roles**: Expert personas that provide specialized perspectives and analysis
3. **Hooks**: Automation scripts that integrate seamlessly into your development workflow

### Core Philosophy

The cookbook follows a principle of "structured AI assistance" - instead of generic prompts, it provides specific, contextual commands that produce consistent, high-quality results for common development scenarios.

/role security
"Security check for this project"

# Sub-agent mode (execute in independent context)
/role security --agent
"Perform a comprehensive security audit of the project"

# Parallel analysis with multiple roles
/multi-role security,performance --agent
"Comprehensively analyze the system's security and performance"
```

### Role Debate Feature

The `/role-debate` command enables multiple expert perspectives to collaborate:

```bash
/role-debate
"Should we use microservices or monolithic architecture for this project?"
```

This command orchestrates discussions between different roles, providing balanced analysis from multiple expert viewpoints.

## Automation Hooks

### Development Automation

The cookbook includes sophisticated hooks that automate common development tasks:

#### File Management Hooks

/pr-list    # Should show current PRs (if in a git repository)
```

## Use Cases and Examples

### 1. Comprehensive Code Review

Scenario: Reviewing a complex pull request with multiple components.

```bash
# Step 1: Get PR overview
/pr-list

# Step 2: Multi-role analysis
/multi-role security,performance,reviewer --agent
"Analyze PR #123 for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality"

# Step 3: Detailed review
/pr-review

# Step 4: Provide structured feedback
/pr-feedback
```

### 2. Feature Development Workflow

Scenario: Developing a new user authentication system.

```bash
# Step 1: Create specification
/spec
"User authentication system with OAuth integration"

# Step 2: Architecture consultation
/role-debate
"OAuth vs JWT vs session-based authentication for our use case"

# Step 3: Implementation planning
/plan

# Step 4: Track progress
/show-plan

# Step 5: Quality assurance
/role qa --agent
"Create comprehensive test strategy for authentication system"
```

### 3. Technical Debt Management

Scenario: Addressing accumulated technical debt in a legacy codebase.

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze technical debt
/tech-debt

# Step 2: Prioritize improvements
/role architect --agent
"Create prioritized technical debt reduction plan"

# Step 3: Safe refactoring
/refactor

# Step 4: Validate changes
/smart-review
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Commands

You can extend the cookbook with custom commands by following the template structure:

```markdown

```

### Environment-Specific Hooks

Configure hooks for different development environments:

```bash
# Development environment
export CLAUDE_ENV="development"

# Production safety hooks
export CLAUDE_ENV="production"
```

### Multi-Project Configuration

For teams working across multiple projects:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "project1": {
      "commands": ["./project1-commands"],
      "roles": ["./project1-roles"]
    },
    "project2": {
      "commands": ["./project2-commands"],
      "roles": ["./project2-roles"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance and Optimization
