### 1. Basic LinkedIn Connection Workflow

**Step 1: Create New Workflow**
- Navigate to "Workflows" section
- Click "Create New Workflow"
- Select "LinkedIn Connection Request"

**Step 2: Define Workflow Steps**
```javascript
const connectionWorkflow = {
  name: "LinkedIn Connection Outreach",
  steps: [
    {
      type: "visit_profile",
      delay: { min: 2000, max: 5000 }
    },
    {
      type: "send_connection_request",
      message: "Hi {firstName}, I'd love to connect and learn more about your work in {industry}.",
      delay: { min: 3000, max: 7000 }
    },
    {
      type: "wait",
      duration: 86400000 // 24 hours
    },
    {
      type: "follow_up_message",
      condition: "connection_accepted",
      message: "Thanks for connecting! I'm working on some interesting projects in {industry} and would love to share insights.",
      delay: { min: 5000, max: 10000 }
    }
  ]
};
```

firstName,lastName,profileUrl,industry,email
John,Doe,https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe,Technology,john@example.com
Jane,Smith,https://linkedin.com/in/janesmith,Marketing,jane@example.com
```

### 2. Advanced Multi-Step Campaign

**Step 1: Campaign Structure**
```javascript
const advancedCampaign = {
  name: "Multi-Touch Outreach Campaign",
  phases: [
    {
      name: "Initial Connection",
      steps: ["visit_profile", "send_connection_request"],
      delay: 0
    },
    {
      name: "Welcome Message",
      steps: ["send_message"],
      delay: 86400000, // 1 day
      condition: "connection_accepted"
    },
    {
      name: "Value Proposition",
      steps: ["send_message"],
      delay: 259200000, // 3 days
      condition: "previous_message_sent"
    },
    {
      name: "Call to Action",
      steps: ["send_message"],
      delay: 604800000, // 7 days

    }
  ]
};
```

**Step 2: Message Templates**
```javascript
const messageTemplates = {
  welcome: "Hi {firstName}! Thanks for connecting. I noticed you work in {industry} - I'm always interested in connecting with professionals in this space.",
  
  value_proposition: "Hi {firstName}, I wanted to share something that might interest you. We've been helping {industry} professionals like yourself achieve {specific_benefit}. Would you be open to a brief conversation?",
  
  call_to_action: "Hi {firstName}, I hope you're doing well! I have a few minutes available this week if you'd like to discuss how we might be able to help with {pain_point}. Would Tuesday or Wednesday work better for you?"
};
```

## Best Practices and Safety Guidelines

### 1. Account Safety

**Daily Limits:**
- Connection requests: 15-20 per day
- Messages: 25-30 per day
- Profile views: 100-150 per day

**Timing Guidelines:**
- Minimum 10-minute intervals between actions
- Randomize action timing (¬±30% variance)
- Respect platform rate limits

### 2. Content Quality

**Connection Request Messages:**
- Keep under 300 characters
- Personalize with profile information
- Avoid sales language
- Focus on mutual value

**Follow-up Messages:**
- Provide genuine value
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Avoid immediate sales pitches
- Maintain conversational tone

### 3. Compliance Considerations

**Legal Requirements:**
- Comply with GDPR/CCPA regulations
- Obtain proper consent for data processing
- Maintain data processing records
- Implement data retention policies

**Platform Terms of Service:**
- Understand automation violates ToS
- Use at your own risk
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Build genuine relationships

## Monitoring and Analytics

### 1. Performance Metrics

**Key Performance Indicators:**
```javascript
const kpis = {
  connection_rate: "accepted_connections / sent_requests",
  response_rate: "responses_received / messages_sent",
  conversion_rate: "qualified_leads / total_connections",
  account_health: "actions_completed / actions_attempted"
};
```

**Step 2: Dashboard Setup**
- Monitor daily activity levels
- Track success rates by message template
- Analyze optimal timing patterns
- Review account health metrics

### 2. Error Handling and Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
```javascript
const troubleshooting = {
  "Authentication Failed": {
    solution: "Re-authenticate account through browser",
    prevention: "Regular cookie refresh"
  },
  "Rate Limited": {
    solution: "Reduce action frequency",
    prevention: "Implement longer delays"
  },
  "Profile Not Found": {
    solution: "Update lead data",
    prevention: "Validate URLs before import"
  }
};
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. API Integration

**Webhook Configuration:**
```javascript
const webhookConfig = {
  url: "https://your-api.com/webhook",
  events: [
    "connection_accepted",
    "message_received",
    "profile_viewed",
    "campaign_completed"
  ],
  authentication: {
    type: "bearer",
    token: "your-api-token"
  }
};
```

**CRM Integration:**
```javascript
// Example Salesforce integration
const crmIntegration = {
  provider: "salesforce",
  credentials: {
    clientId: process.env.SF_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.SF_CLIENT_SECRET,
    username: process.env.SF_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.SF_PASSWORD
  },
  mapping: {
    lead: {
      firstName: "FirstName",
      lastName: "LastName",
      email: "Email",
      company: "Company",
      title: "Title"
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Custom Workflow Development

**Step 1: Create Custom Action**
```javascript
// custom-actions/linkedin-post-engagement.js
class LinkedInPostEngagement {
  async execute(context) {
    const { page, lead, config } = context;
    
    // Navigate to recent posts
    await page.goto(`${lead.profileUrl}/recent-activity/`);
    
    // Find and engage with recent posts
    const posts = await page.$$('.feed-shared-update-v2');
    
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(posts.length, 3); i++) {
      const post = posts[i];
      
      // Like the post
      const likeButton = await post.$('[data-control-name="like"]');
      if (likeButton) {
        await this.humanClick(likeButton);
        await this.randomDelay(2000, 5000);
      }
    }
  }
  
  async humanClick(element) {
    // Implement human-like clicking behavior
    const box = await element.boundingBox();
    const x = box.x + Math.random() * box.width;
    const y = box.y + Math.random() * box.height;
    
    await element.page().mouse.move(x, y, { steps: 10 });
    await this.randomDelay(100, 300);
    await element.page().mouse.click(x, y);
  }
  
  async randomDelay(min, max) {
    const delay = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
  }
}
```
