## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, the boundaries between local computing and cloud services are increasingly blurred. Enter **Puter** - an revolutionary open-source internet operating system that reimagines how we interact with our digital workspace. Developed by HeyPuter, this innovative platform combines the accessibility of web applications with the functionality of a traditional operating system.

Puter represents more than just another cloud storage solution; it's a comprehensive platform that can serve as a privacy-first personal cloud, a development environment, or even an alternative to traditional desktop environments. With over 36,000 stars on GitHub and a thriving community, Puter has captured the attention of developers and users seeking a modern, extensible computing experience.

## What is Puter?

**üåê Web-Native**
- Runs entirely in the browser
- Cross-platform compatibility
- No installation required for basic usage

### Use Cases

Puter serves multiple purposes depending on your needs:

1. **Personal Cloud Platform**: Replace Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive with a self-controlled alternative
2. **Development Environment**: Build and deploy websites, web applications, and games
3. **Remote Desktop**: Access your computing environment from anywhere
4. **Educational Platform**: Learn about web development, cloud computing, and distributed systems
5. **Corporate Solution**: Deploy internal tools and applications

## System Requirements

Before diving into the installation process, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

### Minimum Requirements
- **Operating Systems**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **RAM**: 2GB minimum (4GB recommended for optimal performance)
- **Disk Space**: 1GB free space for local development
- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher (Version 23+ recommended)
- **npm**: Latest stable version
- **Browser**: Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Recommended Specifications
- **RAM**: 8GB or more for heavy usage
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor for better performance
- **Storage**: SSD for faster file operations
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for cloud features

## Installation Methods

Puter offers several installation methods to accommodate different use cases and technical preferences. We'll explore each method in detail.

### Method 1: Local Development Setup

This method is ideal for developers who want to modify Puter or contribute to the project.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the Puter repository
git clone https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd puter
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all required npm packages
npm install
```

This command will download and install all necessary dependencies as defined in the `package.json` file.

#### Step 3: Start the Development Server

```bash
# Launch Puter in development mode
npm start
```

After running this command, Puter should automatically launch in your default web browser at `http://puter.localhost:4100` (or the next available port).

#### Troubleshooting Local Development

If the local development setup doesn't work immediately, consider these common solutions:

**Port Conflicts**
```bash
# Check if port 4100 is already in use
lsof -i :4100

# Kill the process if necessary
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Node.js Version Issues**
```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version

# Update Node.js if needed (using nvm)
nvm install node
nvm use node
```

**Permission Issues**
```bash
# Fix npm permission issues (Linux/macOS)
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
```

### Method 2: Docker Deployment

Docker provides a containerized environment that ensures consistent behavior across different systems.

#### Quick Docker Run

For a simple, one-command deployment:

```bash
# Create necessary directories and run Puter
mkdir puter && cd puter && \
mkdir -p puter/config puter/data && \
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 puter && \
docker run --rm -p 4100:4100 \
  -v `pwd`/puter/config:/etc/puter \
  -v `pwd`/puter/data:/var/puter \
  ghcr.io/heyputer/puter
```

This command will:
1. Create the necessary directory structure
2. Set appropriate permissions
3. Mount configuration and data volumes
4. Start Puter on port 4100

#### Understanding Docker Volumes

The Docker setup uses two important volumes:
- **Configuration Volume** (`/etc/puter`): Stores Puter's configuration files
- **Data Volume** (`/var/puter`): Stores user data and files

### Method 3: Docker Compose

Docker Compose provides a more structured approach to container orchestration.

#### Linux/macOS Setup

```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p puter/config puter/data

# Set proper permissions
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 puter

# Download docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeyPuter/puter/main/docker-compose.yml

# Start the services
docker compose up
```

#### Windows Setup

```powershell
# Create directories
mkdir -p puter
cd puter
New-Item -Path "puter\config" -ItemType Directory -Force
New-Item -Path "puter\data" -ItemType Directory -Force

# Download docker-compose.yml
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeyPuter/puter/main/docker-compose.yml" -OutFile "docker-compose.yml"

# Start the services
docker compose up
```

#### Docker Compose Benefits

Using Docker Compose offers several advantages:
- **Reproducible deployments**: Consistent environment across different machines
- **Easy updates**: Simple command to pull and deploy new versions
- **Configuration management**: Centralized configuration through environment variables
- **Service orchestration**: Easy to add additional services like databases or reverse proxies

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

Puter supports various environment variables for customization:

```bash
# .env file example
PUTER_PORT=4100
PUTER_DOMAIN=puter.localhost
PUTER_DEBUG=true
PUTER_DB_PATH=/var/puter/database
```

### Custom Domain Setup

For production deployments, you'll want to configure a custom domain:

```bash
# Update your domain configuration
PUTER_DOMAIN=your-domain.com
PUTER_PORT=80
```

### SSL/TLS Configuration

For secure HTTPS connections:

```nginx
# Nginx reverse proxy configuration
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4100;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
