## Introduction: Beyond Vibe Coding

Every development team faces the same productivity killers:

- **Context evaporates** between sessions, forcing constant re-discovery
- **Parallel work creates conflicts** when multiple developers touch the same code
- **Requirements drift** as verbal decisions override written specs
- **Progress becomes invisible** until the very end

[Claude Code Project Management (CCPM)](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm) solves all of these problems with a revolutionary approach that transforms how AI-assisted development works.

### What Makes CCPM Revolutionary?

Traditional Claude Code workflows operate in isolation – a single developer working with AI in their local environment. CCPM breaks this limitation by using **GitHub Issues as the database** and **Git worktrees for parallel execution**.

| Traditional Development | CCPM System |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Context lost between sessions | **Persistent context** across all work |
| Serial task execution | **Parallel agents** on independent tasks |
| "Vibe coding" from memory | **Spec-driven** with full traceability |
| Progress hidden in branches | **Transparent audit trail** in GitHub |
| Manual task coordination | **Intelligent prioritization** |

## Prerequisites and Setup

### System Requirements

- macOS (recommended) or Linux
- Git 2.30+
- Claude Code (Anthropic's coding assistant)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Node.js 18+ (for some automation scripts)

### macOS Quick Test Script

For macOS users, you can use our automated test script to validate your environment and try CCPM:

```bash
# Download and run the CCPM test script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/automazeio/ccpm/main/scripts/test-workflow.sh | bash

# Or if you have this repository locally:
./scripts/test-ccpm-workflow.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Check all system prerequisites
- ✅ Create a test project with CCPM installed
- ✅ Validate the installation
- ✅ Create sample PRD and Epic files
- ✅ Test GitHub CLI integration (if available)
- ✅ Provide next steps for Claude Code integration

### Quick Installation (2 Minutes)

**Step 1: Clone CCPM into Your Project**

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/project/

# Clone CCPM system
git clone https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm.git .
```

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: If you already have a `.claude` directory, clone to a temporary directory and merge the contents manually.

**Step 2: Initialize the PM System**

```bash
# In Claude Code, run:
/pm:init
```

This command will:
- Install GitHub CLI (if needed)
- Authenticate with GitHub
- Install `gh-sub-issue` extension for parent-child relationships
- Create required directories
- Update `.gitignore`

**Step 3: Configure Repository Settings**

Create or update your `CLAUDE.md`:

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/init include rules from .claude/CLAUDE.md

# If you already have CLAUDE.md:
/re-init
```

**Step 4: Prime the System**

```bash
# Initialize context system
/context:create
```

## Core Workflow: From Idea to Production

### Phase 1: PRD (Product Requirements Document) Creation

The foundation of CCPM is **spec-driven development**. Everything starts with a comprehensive PRD.

**Starting a New Feature:**

```bash
/pm:prd-new memory-system
```

This launches an **interactive brainstorming session** that creates a detailed PRD covering:

- **Problem Statement**: What exactly are we solving?
- **Success Metrics**: How do we measure success?
- **User Stories**: Who benefits and how?
- **Technical Constraints**: What are our limitations?
- **Edge Cases**: What could go wrong?
- **Integration Points**: How does this fit with existing systems?

**Example PRD Structure:**

```markdown
# Memory System PRD

## Problem Statement
Users lose context between Claude Code sessions, leading to repeated explanations and slower development cycles.

## Success Metrics
- 90% reduction in context re-establishment time
- 75% fewer repeated questions
- Persistent project understanding across sessions

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want Claude to remember our previous architectural decisions
- As a team lead, I want consistent context across team members
- As a product manager, I want feature requirements preserved between sessions

## Technical Architecture
- File-based memory storage in `.claude/memory/`
- Automatic context loading on session start
- Structured memory categories (decisions, patterns, constraints)

## Integration Points
- Existing `.claude/` directory structure
- GitHub Issues for progress tracking
- Git hooks for automatic memory updates
```

### Phase 2: Epic Planning and Task Decomposition

Once your PRD is complete, transform it into an actionable epic with detailed tasks.

**Parse PRD into Epic:**

```bash
/pm:prd-parse memory-system
```

This creates:
- **Epic overview** with clear objectives
- **Technical breakdown** of required components
- **Task list** with dependencies mapped
- **Effort estimates** for each component
- **Parallel execution plan** for maximum efficiency

**Example Epic Structure:**

```
Epic: Memory System Implementation

├── Task 1: Core Memory Infrastructure
│   ├── Create memory storage system
│   ├── Implement context loading
│   └── Add memory persistence hooks
│
├── Task 2: Memory Management Interface
│   ├── Design memory CRUD operations
│   ├── Build memory search functionality
│   └── Create memory visualization tools
│
└── Task 3: Integration and Testing
    ├── Integrate with existing workflows
    ├── Add comprehensive test suite
    └── Create documentation and examples
```

### Phase 3: GitHub Integration and Issue Creation

Transform your epic into a structured GitHub project with full traceability.

**One-Shot Epic to GitHub:**

```bash
/pm:epic-oneshot memory-system
```

This command:
1. **Creates parent epic issue** in GitHub
2. **Generates child task issues** with proper relationships
3. **Sets up labels and milestones** for organization
4. **Initializes progress tracking** with completion metrics
5. **Creates local task files** linked to GitHub issues

**Example GitHub Structure:**

```
Issue #1234 (Epic): Memory System Implementation
├── Issue #1235: Core Memory Infrastructure  
├── Issue #1236: Memory Management Interface
└── Issue #1237: Integration and Testing
```

Each issue contains:
- Detailed technical specifications
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Estimated effort and complexity
- Links to related issues and documentation

### Phase 4: Parallel Agent Execution

Here's where CCPM truly shines – **multiple specialized agents working simultaneously**.

**Starting Work on Issues:**

```bash
# Start work on infrastructure task
/pm:issue-start 1235

# In parallel, start interface work
/pm:issue-start 1236

# And testing preparation
/pm:issue-start 1237
```

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**

1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent focuses on their specific domain
   - **Infrastructure Agent**: Database schemas, file systems, core logic
   - **Interface Agent**: APIs, user interfaces, integration points  
   - **Testing Agent**: Test suites, validation, documentation

2. **Worktree Management**: Each issue gets its own Git worktree
   ```
   ../epic-memory-system/
   ├── main/           # Primary development branch
   ├── issue-1235/     # Infrastructure work
   ├── issue-1236/     # Interface development  
   └── issue-1237/     # Testing and integration
   ```

3. **Context Isolation**: Agents maintain separate contexts
   ```
   .claude/context/
   ├── epic-memory-system/
   │   ├── infrastructure-context.md
   │   ├── interface-context.md
   │   └── testing-context.md
   ```

### Phase 5: Progress Management and Coordination

Monitor and coordinate work across all parallel streams.

**Check Overall Status:**

```bash
/pm:status
```

**Sample Status Output:**
```
Memory System Epic Progress: 67% Complete

✅ Issue #1235: Core Infrastructure (Complete)
   - Memory storage system ✅
   - Context loading ✅  
   - Persistence hooks ✅

🚧 Issue #1236: Management Interface (In Progress)
   - CRUD operations ✅
   - Search functionality 🚧
   - Visualization tools ⏳

⏳ Issue #1237: Integration & Testing (Pending)
   - Workflow integration ⏳
   - Test suite ⏳
   - Documentation ⏳
```

**Get Next Priority Task:**

```bash
/pm:next
```

This intelligently suggests the next most important task based on:
- **Dependencies**: What's blocking other work?
- **Effort estimates**: Quick wins vs. complex tasks
- **Team capacity**: What can be done in parallel?
- **Business priority**: What delivers value soonest?

  - Issue #1242: Authentication Service  
  - Issue #1243: API Endpoints
  - Issue #1244: Frontend Integration
  - Issue #1245: Security & Testing

### Step 4: Parallel Execution

```bash
# Start database work
/pm:issue-start 1241

# Simultaneously start service layer
/pm:issue-start 1242  

# And prepare API structure
/pm:issue-start 1243
```

**Agent Coordination:**
- **Database Agent**: Creates schemas, migrations, and data models
- **Service Agent**: Implements JWT logic, OAuth flows, session management
- **API Agent**: Builds REST endpoints with proper validation and error handling

Each agent works in isolation but coordinates through:
- Shared interface definitions
- Common data structures
- Coordinated testing strategies

### Step 5: Integration and Deployment

```bash
# Check integration points
/pm:epic-show user-authentication

# Validate all components work together
/pm:validate

# Final status before deployment
/pm:status
```

**Final Integration:**
All worktrees merge back into main branch with:
- Complete authentication system
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Full documentation
- Deployment-ready configuration

## Best Practices and Pro Tips

### 1. PRD Quality is Everything

**Invest Time in Detailed PRDs:**
- Spend 20-30% of project time on PRD creation
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Define success metrics clearly
- Document integration requirements thoroughly

**PRD Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Vague requirements ("make it fast")
- Missing error handling scenarios
- Undefined success metrics
- No consideration of existing system constraints

### 2. Task Decomposition Strategy

**Optimal Task Size:**
- 1-3 days of work per task
- Clear input/output definitions
- Minimal dependencies between tasks
- Testable completion criteria

**Parallel-Friendly Decomposition:**
```bash
# Good: Clear separation of concerns
- Task A: Database layer
- Task B: Business logic  
- Task C: API layer
- Task D: Frontend components

# Bad: Sequential dependencies
- Task 1: Start everything
- Task 2: Continue everything  
- Task 3: Finish everything
```

### 3. Context Management

**Keep Contexts Focused:**
- Each agent maintains domain-specific context
- Main thread stays strategic, not tactical
- Regular context cleanup prevents bloat
- Document key decisions in persistent memory

**Context Anti-Patterns:**
- Mixing implementation details in main thread
- Agents sharing overlapping contexts
- Never cleaning completed work contexts
- Losing architectural decisions between sessions

### 4. Team Collaboration

**GitHub Issue Hygiene:**
- Clear, actionable issue titles
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Regular progress updates in comments
- Proper labeling and milestone assignment

**Human-AI Collaboration:**
- Humans can jump into any issue at any time
