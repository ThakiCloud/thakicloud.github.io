## Introduction: Revolutionizing Development with AI Agents

The [Contains Studio AI Agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents) repository represents a paradigm shift in how development teams approach rapid prototyping and product creation. This comprehensive collection of 30+ specialized AI agents transforms the traditional development workflow by providing domain-specific expertise at every stage of the development lifecycle.

Unlike generic AI assistants, each agent in this system is meticulously crafted with deep domain knowledge, specific tools, and contextual understanding of rapid development principles. Whether you're building a meditation tracking app, analyzing user feedback, or optimizing app store presence, there's a specialized agent ready to accelerate your workflow.

## Understanding the Agent Architecture

### Core Philosophy: 6-Day Sprint Development

The entire agent system is built around the philosophy of **6-day sprints** - the idea that you can build, test, and ship meaningful products in just six days. This isn't about cutting corners; it's about leveraging AI expertise to eliminate bottlenecks and focus on what matters most: delivering value to users.

### Agent Specialization Model

Each agent follows a carefully designed structure:

```yaml
---
name: agent-identifier
description: When to use + detailed examples
color: visual-identification
tools: specific-capabilities
---
```

The system prompt for each agent contains:
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep knowledge in their specific area
- **Sprint Integration**: Understanding of rapid development constraints
- **Best Practices**: Proven methodologies and approaches
- **Success Metrics**: Clear ways to measure effectiveness

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before installing the agents, ensure you have:
- **Claude Code** installed and configured
- Access to the `~/.claude/agents/` directory
- Git for cloning the repository

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/contains-studio/agents.git
cd agents
```

2. **Copy Agents to Claude Directory**
```bash
# Option 1: Copy all agents
cp -r * ~/.claude/agents/

# Option 2: Selective installation by department
cp -r engineering/ ~/.claude/agents/
cp -r design/ ~/.claude/agents/
cp -r marketing/ ~/.claude/agents/
```

3. **Restart Claude Code**
After copying the agents, restart Claude Code to load the new agents into the system.

4. **Verify Installation**
Test the installation by describing a task that should trigger an agent:
```
"Create a new app for tracking meditation habits"
```
This should automatically invoke the `rapid-prototyper` agent.
