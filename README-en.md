## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Write a Blog Post

Follow these steps to contribute content to the Thaki Cloud tech blog:

### 1. Choose a Category

Select the most appropriate category for your post. Current categories:

- `dev` (Development & Architecture)
- `llmops` (LLM Ops & AI Engineering)
- `tutorials` (Technical Insights & Tutorials)

Each category has its own folder under `_posts/` (e.g., `_posts/dev/`, `_posts/llmops/`).

### 2. Create a Post File

- Navigate to the appropriate `_posts/<category>/` folder.
- Create a new Markdown file: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md`
  - Example: `2024-07-30-optimizing-inference-speed.md`

### 3. Add Front Matter

Include metadata at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
title: "Optimizing LLM Inference Speed: A Practical Guide"
categories:
  - llmops
# Optional: tags:
#   - performance
#   - llm
#   - optimization
# Optional: author override (see _config.yml)
# author: "Your Name"
# Optional: excerpt for list previews
# excerpt: "Learn key techniques to dramatically improve LLM inference performance..."
---
```

### 4. Write Your Content

Write your content below the front matter using Markdown.  
Example:

```markdown
## Introduction

Welcome to our practical guide on optimizing LLM inference speed...

### Key Techniques

1. **Quantization**: ...
2. **Pruning**: ...
```

Use all standard Markdown features: headings, lists, code blocks, images, etc.

### 5. Add Images (Optional)

- Place images in a new folder under `assets/images/posts/` (e.g., `assets/images/posts/optimizing-inference-speed/`)
- Link images in Markdown:
  ```markdown
  ![Alt Text](/assets/images/posts/optimizing-inference-speed/image-name.png)
  ```

### 6. Preview Locally

If you have Jekyll set up locally:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to preview your post.

### 7. Publish the Post
